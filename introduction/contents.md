This is a two-part protocol-book. The first teaches fundamental computational skills necessary to succeed in the field of synthetic biology. You will learn how to \(1\) use existing tools and software to quickly design robust, functional genetic systems, and to \(2\) effectively develop your own scientific models and design algorithms. Sections include:

1. **Computational Starter Guides**. This chapter includes a beginner's guide to [Linux](../computational-workflow/linux/), how to access and take advantage of our lab's [Computing Resources](../computational-workflow/server-computing/), how to be a [\#Pythonista](../computational-workflow/dev/) when cooking up your own tools.
2. **Salis Lab Software**. How to use the Salis lab's software package - the [DNA Compiler](../computational-workflow/dna-compiler/) \(DNAc\) - both through our website and in Python scripting environments.
3. **Other Computational Tools**. Guides to other miscellaneous [bioinformatics](../computational-workflow/bioinformatics-tools/) and [cloning resources](../computational-workflow/dna-sequence-editors/).

The second half teaches the molecular biology techniques and protocols required to build your designed genetic system. Chapters include:

1. **Microbiology 101**. Basic techniques including, but not limited to, [how to autoclave media and glassware](../molecular-biology/microbiology-101/autoclaving.md), [how to store your bacteria](../molecular-biology/microbiology-101/bacteria-storage.md), and [how to deal with a phage outbreak](../molecular-biology/microbiology-101/bacteriophages.md) in the unfortunate event that one occurs.
2. **Design & Build**. Describes how to engineer your specific genetic system, how to design an set of experiments that best suits your project's needs, and techniques and protocols to build your system.
3. **Test**. Methods to test your system's function.

Our philosophy in this book is to be to the point and succinct, with references to other great online resources when needed. This git-protocol-book is by no means comprehensive, but merely an introduction to key workflows to get you started, and a repository for experimental methods that have been developed in the Salis lab. When in doubt, google something if you have a question - the internet of knowledge is a powerful tool in a scientist's toolbox in the modern day of technology, and if you can't find answers to your questions here or online, ask Dr. Salis and senior students for help.

Best of luck in all your scientific pursuits,

-Alex, Grace, Sean, Daniel, Ayaan
