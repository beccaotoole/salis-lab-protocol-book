# Salis Lab Protocol Book

This [Git Protocol Book](https://www.gitbook.com/) introduces skills in computational biology and experimental microbiology, the skills required to be successful synthetic biologists. First, you'll be introduced to popular bioinformatics tools, our best practices for software development, and a how-to-guide for using the DNA Compiler \(DNAc\). With these tools, you'll be well equiped to _design_ and _study_ synthetic genetic systems. Secondly, you'll be introduced to conceptual workflows, basic lab techniques, and experimental protocols to _build_ and _test_ your designed genetic systems. Continue reading [here](/expwork.md) for more details on the contents of this protocol book and how to get started in the Salis lab.

### Under Construction

There are many pages of this protocol book that need protocols filled in or heavy formatting. There are two very _easy _ways of editing this Git Protocol Book. The easiest way is to use the [GitBook Editor](https://legacy.gitbook.com/editor). Another way is to directly commit changes to the GitHub repository where the protocols are hosted: [https://github.com/reisalex/salis-lab-protocol-book](https://github.com/reisalex/salis-lab-protocol-book). With this approach, when you add pages this way, make sure to update [SUMMARY.md](/SUMMARY.md). You'll need to request editing access from me: alex.reis at psu.
