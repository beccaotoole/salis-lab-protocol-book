# Salis Lab Protocol Book

This [Git Protocol Book](https://www.gitbook.com/) introduces skills in computational biology and experimental microbiology. First, you'll be introduced to popular bioinformatics tools, our best practices for software development, and a how-to-guide for using the DNA Compiler \(DNAc\). With these tools, you'll be well equipped to _design_ and _study_ synthetic genetic systems. Secondly, you'll be introduced to conceptual workflows, basic lab techniques, and experimental protocols to _build_ and _test_ your designed genetic systems. Continue reading [here](getting-started/contents.md) for more details on the contents of this protocol book and how to get started in the Salis lab.

## Under Construction

There are many pages of this protocol book that need protocols filled in or heavy formatting. There are two very _easy_ ways of editing this Git Protocol Book. The easiest way is to edit the pages in your browser by clicking on the "Edit this page" on the right. Another way is to directly commit changes to the GitHub repository where the protocol pages are hosted: [https://github.com/reisalex/salis-lab-protocol-book](https://github.com/reisalex/salis-lab-protocol-book). With the later approach, make sure to update [SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/reisalex/salis-lab-protocol-book/tree/453898c9360786eef221e6fffd8409c03a547e50/SUMMARY.md) when you add new pages. You'll need to request editing access from Dr. Salis for both methods.
