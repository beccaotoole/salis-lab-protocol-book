# Salis Lab Protocol Book

This [Git Protocol Book](https://www.gitbook.com/) introduces skills in computational biology and experimental microbiology, the skills required to be successful synthetic biologists. First, you'll be introduced to popular bioinformatics tools, our best practices for software development, and a how-to-guide for using the DNA Compiler \(DNAc\). With these tools, you'll be well equiped to _design_ and _study_ synthetic genetic systems. Secondly, you'll be introduced to conceptual workflows, basic lab techniques, and experimental protocols to _build_ and _test_ your designed genetic systems. Continue reading [here](/expwork.md) for more details on the contents of this protocol book and how to get started in the Salis lab.

### Under Construction

This Gitbook is currently under heavy development. If you're reading this, that means many of the linked pages are still empty, and we are still adding new pages and protocols. Check back later.
