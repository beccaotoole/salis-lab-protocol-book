# Salis Lab Protocol Book

This [Git Protocol Book](https://www.gitbook.com/) introduces skills in computational biology and experimental microbiology with a focus on synthetic biology. First, you'll be introduced to popular bioinformatics tools, our list of best practices for software development, and a how-to-guide for the DNA Compiler \(DNAc\). With these tools, you'll be well equiped to design and study synthetic genetic systems. Secondly, you'll be introduced to conceptual workflows, basic lab techniques, and experimental protocols to build and test your designed genetic systems. Continue reading ["So you want to be a computational biologist?"](compwork.md) and ["So you want to be a synthetic biologist?"](expwork.md) for more details on the contents of this protocol book.

### Under Construction

This Gitbook is currently under heavy development. If you're reading this, that means many of the linked pages are still empty, and we are still adding new pages and protocols. Check back later.
