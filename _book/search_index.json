The first teaches fundamental computational skills necessary to succeed in the field of synthetic biology. You will learn how to (1) use existing tools and software to quickly design robust, functional genetic systems, and to (2) effectively develop your own scientific models and design algorithms. Chapters include:\n\nComputational Workflow. This chapter includes a beginner's guide to Linux, how to access and take advantage of our lab's Computing Resources, how to be a #Pythonista when cooking up your own tools.\nSalis Lab Software. How to use the Salis lab's software package - the DNA Compiler (DNAc) - both through our website and in Python scripting environments.\nOther Computational Tools. Guides to other miscellaneous bioinformatics and cloning resources.\n\nThe second half teaches the molecular biology techniques and protocols required to build your designed genetic system. Chapters include:\n\nMicrobiology 101. Basic techniques including, but not limited to, sterile technique, how to autoclave media and glassware, how to store your bacteria, and how to deal with a phage outbreak in the unfortunate event that one occurs.\nDesign. Describes how to engineer your specific genetic system and how to select the cloning strategy that best suits your project's needs.\nBuild. Techniques and experimental protocols.\nTest. Methods to test your system's function.\n\nOur philosophy in this book is to be to the point and succinct, with references to other great online resources when needed. This git-protocol-book is by no means comprehensive, but merely an introduction to key workflows to get you started, and a repository for experimental methods that have been developed in the Salis lab. When in doubt, google something if you have a question - the internet of knowledge is a powerful tool in a scientist's toolbox in the modern day of technology, and if you can't find answers to your questions here or online, ask Dr. Salis and senior students for help.\nBest of luck in all your scientific pursuits,\n-Alex, Grace, Sean, Daniel, Ayaan\n"},"computational-workflow/linux/":{"url":"computational-workflow/linux/","title":"Linux","keywords":"","body":"Linux\nThe Linux operating systems are fundamental to the world of scientific computing. Almost all major scientific tools across all scientific disciplines are developed and maintained in Linux. Scientists routinely execute their tools and analyses in a Linux environment. Part of this is because Linux is a solidly engineered operating system, is robust, and free. At Salis Lab we always adhere to the most cutting edge tools, and thus must conform to the Linux philosophy or open-source software and wide-spread collaboration.\nIn this part of the book, we introduce you how to install a Linux OS and how to use the BASH (Bourne-Again Shell) to perform basic tasks. These will include creating (C), reading (R), updating (U) and deleting (D) (collecively termed as CRUD operations) files and directories and navigating the file system. We will also demonstrate how to install some basic programs that will be immediately useful to you in your lab-work (for example, a modern text-editor). Finally, most of the open-sourced (or closed-sourced) software and analyses are usually stored in websites like GitHub that use the git protocol. For example, all of our code including this gitbook is hosted on GitHub. So, we will demonstrate how to use the git version control system to download a git repository and keep it updated from using our Private-Code hosted on GitHub as an example.\n"},"computational-workflow/linux/install.html":{"url":"computational-workflow/linux/install.html","title":"Install","keywords":"","body":"Install\nStep 1. Best of both worlds -- dual boot\nChances are your PC comes installed with some version of Windows. While Windows is good for major everyday tasks, scientific computing doesn't usually happen on Windows for reasons already explained in the intro page. However, you will still need Windows to write your papers in MS Word, create your supplementary data Excel files, and develop your publication figures in Adobe Illustrator. The solution is then to install Linux besides Windows, and make your PC dual boot. You will then have the option of booting into Linux or Windows on starting up your PC.\nGenerally, the two steps involved in making your PC dual boot are:\n\nPartitioning your hard disk to have unallocated space in to which Linux will be installed.\nInstalling your Linux into this unallocated space.\n\nA handy guide to partition the hard disk space from within Windows 10 for Linux installation can be found at http://dailylinuxuser.com/2015/11/how-to-shrink-windows-10-to-make-space.html\nStep 2. Selecting a Linux distribution.\nThere are many different Linux distributions (or distros as pundits call them) often each with multiple flavors. For example, one popular distro is Ubuntu, that has different flavors such as:\n\nKubuntu — Ubuntu with the K Desktop environment.\nLubuntu — Ubuntu that uses LXDE.\nMythbuntu — Designed for creating a home theatre PC with MythTV.\nUbuntu Budgie — Simplicity and elegance – Budgie desktop powered by Ubuntu.\nUbuntu GNOME — Ubuntu with the GNOME desktop environment.\n\nThere are different reasons to select different distributions, and flavors therein. One reason might be hardware compatibility -- you have an old PC and Ubuntu's latest LTS (long term support) release might require more powerful hardware unavailable on your PC. Time to shift gears and choose a lightweight Ubuntu flavor such as Lubuntu. Also different major distributions have different package management and customization features. You can select one you like the most. No matter the situation, there is always a Linux distribution that will play by your rules. Fun fact: The popular Linux distribution Kali Linux is dedicated to computer hackers for developing malwares and delving in cyber-crime!\nAt the time of this article being originally written, Elementary OS is popular in the lab. Looks like Mac OS, and has all the power and technical semblance of Ubuntu -- same package managers, same app support, wide availability of drivers etc.\nStep 3. Installing the Linux distribution\nThe exact steps are dependent on the Linux distro you have selected but generally involves the following.\n\nDowloading the distro ISO file from website. For example, you can download the latest Elementary OS ISO file for free (just put in $0 in the price box) from https://elementary.io/\nBurning the ISO file onto a USB memory stick and making it bootable. For example, you can use a program like Unetbootin available at https://unetbootin.github.io/\nDocking the USB memory stick in to your USB port and (re)starting the system. If your burning was successful, you will be able to boot in to the OS setup screen. Just follow on-screen directions.\nBe careful when setting up disk space allocation. Generally, all you need to specify are the root and swap disk space. Ideally, for your swap you will allocate the same amount of disk space as your available RAM and put rest of the substantial allocation from Step 1 (say 1 terabyte) for your root. The root will hold all your files and home directory, so make sure you have enough space there. For swap, if you allocate more memory than your RAM, it will be wasteful -- the swap space on the disk is where your entire RAM content is dumped if your OS knows it is about to crash or if you hibernate your system as opposed to shutting it down.\n\nFor detailed instructions on installing the latest Elementary OS, follow the instruction on this page: https://itsfoss.com/guide-install-elementary-os-luna/\n"},"computational-workflow/linux/using-bash.html":{"url":"computational-workflow/linux/using-bash.html","title":"Using Bash","keywords":"","body":"Using Bash\nDescribe what bash is and basic guide to use and navigating in it.\n"},"computational-workflow/linux/crud-files-and-directories.html":{"url":"computational-workflow/linux/crud-files-and-directories.html","title":"CRUD files & directories","keywords":"","body":"CRUD files & directories\nDefine CRUD.

See the download page here:\nhttps://www.sublimetext.com/3\nAnd if you want to install on Linux, see how to install with your flavor package manager:\nhttps://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/linux_repositories.html\nNotepad++\nNotepad++ is a decent text editor. It allows FTP protocol via the FTPExplorerPlugin. Notepad++ is highly customizable and easy to use. Download here:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.3.1.html\nGeany (Ubuntu)\nGeany is an OK option. Geany is available through the official Ubuntu archives (Universe section).

Git is a mature, actively maintained open-source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open-source.\"\n...OK what? This is the introduction paragraph on a What is Git resource page, and admittedly it's not very informative. The first time I read about version control, I was overwhelmed. Computer scientists are notorious for using technical jargon - and the world of Git is no exception. There are dozens of content-rich websites describing \"how to Git\" at various skill levels, and while they contain everything you need to know, they tend to poorly describe the usage that you might use in your own workday. I find that I am frequently describing git basics to new students in our lab, and while I recommend you go and read up on version control and Git on your own, this guide is designed to teach basic usage.\nWhy do we use Git?\nFor development we need a way to: 1. Maintain a history of development. 2. Collaborate on projects. 3. Use resources developed by other people. 4. Share our code with the world.\nVersion control\nThe above list is exactly what Git does for us. The first two items describe what is called version control. Version control allows us to track changes in computer files and coordinate work on those files among multiple people. With version control you can see how your changes affect your project before \"committing\" to them (we'll discuss commit as a command in a bit). If you notice that something broke in your project that worked before, you can simply roll back one revision at a time until you find the revision that caused the regression. Version control also allows us to concurrently edit files. Git manages differences in files (diff, another command), and won't allow you to overwrite changes to files that you teammates have made, without resolving those differences first. If you try, Git will tell you there is a merge conflict that must be resolved.\nRepositories\nGit manages a directory of code for a project, we call this a repository. Every collaborator on a project copies the repository to their machine (clone) and can make changes locally. Every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. We will see in the Git commands section how changes to your local repo can get \"pushed\" (push) and how changes made by the team can be \"pulled\" (pull) from the server version of shared repository.\nOur group uses GitHub, a Git repository hosting service, to host our shared repository, Private-Code. This repository hosts the core package that our group develops, the DNA Compiler. GitHub offers two types of repositories: public and private. Private-Code is a private respository, meaning only collaborators can see the code.\nPublic repositories are great when you want to share your code with the world to use. Code that is public is called open-source. My first project was to develop a model test system for sequence-function gene expression models. We decided to open-source the project so that anyone interested in model development can use it. Check it out at test-sfm. If you're looking for a quick guide on how to create and build your own repository go to Setting up a repo.\n\nGitHub has a mascot called Octocat, a cat with five tentacles and a human-like face.\nSalis Lab Private-Code\nNavigate to Private-Code. If you can't, that means you need to get Dr. Salis to add you as a collaborator. Email him now! You'll need to set up a username and password for GitHub.\nGit commands\nThe basic Git commands I use on a daily basis are listed below. If you read through the rest of this page in order, you can follow along by executing the same commands. By the end of this mini-tutorial, you'll have the latest version of the Private-Code repository on your local machine, and you'll even make your first contribution to our code base!\nTo proceed, you should be working in a Unix-based OS (Mac OS or a Linux derivative). Git comes pre-installed on most Debian-based Linux operating systems (e.g. Ubuntu, elementary). To my knowledge, if you are in a Mac OS you need to install Git from the download page.\nThe first time you use Git, it will ask you to provide your name and email address. You can do this with the following commands. Instead of \"Your Name\" you would put your name (e.g. Alex Reis) and instead of \"email@psu.edu\" you would put your email (e.g. alex.reis@psu.edu).\n$ git config --global --user.name \"Your Name\"\n$ git config --global --user.email \"email@psu.edu\"\n\nIf you forget to define your user.name and user.email, you won't get any further in this tutorial, because GitHub will demand that you run these two commands before you execute any others.\nNote: For the purposes of this tutorial, were are working on the default branch only, master. Branches are were Git gets a bit more complicated. For our purposes, master is the branch of interest for us, although Private-Code has other branches (e.g. commercial). Branches are neat ways of working on different versions of the same repository from different commit points. Hang in there.\nclone\nClones a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository (visible using git branch -r), and creates and checks out an initial branch that is forked from the cloned repository’s currently active branch.\nOpen Terminal. Use git clone to clone the Private-Code repository into your root directory.\n$ git clone https://github.com/hsalis/Private-Code.git\n\npull\nIncorporates changes from a remote repository into the current branch. In the case of using GitHub, you \"pull\" down any changes that other users have \"pushed\" to the GitHub hosted version of the repo.\nFirst, step into the Private-Code directory, and then run a git pull now:\ncd Private-Code\n/Private-Code$ git pull\n\nOutput:\nAlready up-to-date.\n\nThis makes sense, because you just cloned the repository and downloaded all the files are are currently there. It is possible that within the few seconds between your git clone and your git pull commands, that someone in our lab pushed changes. In that case you would see a listing of the changed files that you just pulled down.\nstatus\nDisplays (1) paths (files or directories) that have differences between the index file and the current HEAD commit, (2) paths that have differences between the working tree and the index file, and paths in the working tree that are not tracked by Git.\nA little confusing, I know. Just give it a try:\n/Private-Code$ git status\n\nOutput:\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\nnothing to commit, working directory clean\n\nLet's try two things:\n(STEP 1) Open the file that renders this page (Private-Code/protocol-book/01_Linux/git.md) in your favorite text editor. Make a change to this file by adding your name under Git Masters exactly how I have my name formatted. Save the file. By the end of this tutorial, you're name will be here on this page! You will have become a Git master. Keep up the good work!\n(STEP 2) Let's do one other thing. Make a dummy file in the root directory of Private-Code (we'll delete it in a moment):\n/Private-Code$ touch tutorial.txt\n\nNow, run git status again:\n/Private-Code$ git status\n\nYou should see:\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add ...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git checkout -- ...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n\n    modified:   protocol-book/01_Linux/git.md\n\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add ...\" to include in what will be committed)\n\n    tutorial.txt\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n\nBecause the first file (git.md) was an existing part of the repository and was being tracked, it is listed under \"Changes not staged for commit\". In other words, Git knows the file, and acknowledges that there are differences. Git also sees an unfamiliar file, tutorial.txt, and puts it under \"Untracked files\".\ndiff\nShow changes between the working tree and the index or a tree, changes between the index and a tree, changes between two trees, changes between two blob objects, or changes between two files on disk.\nIn other words, git diff shows you the changes between two files. If you simply specify git diff  it will show you deletions and additions between your file and the file described by the local index on the same branch. Go ahead and run this command for the git.md file you added your name to.\n/Private-Code$ git diff protocol-book/01_Linux/git.md\n\nOutput should have something like this in it:\ndiff --git a/protocol-book/01_Linux/git.md b/protocol-book/01_Linux/git.md\nindex edb7b09..05591a1 100644\n--- a/protocol-book/01_Linux/git.md\n+++ b/protocol-book/01_Linux/git.md\n@@ -1,3 +1,5 @@\n # Git\n+* Your Name\n\\ No newline at end of file\n\nYou should see your name in green, which indicates that you added that line.\nThere is more complex usage to see the difference between your local repo and the GitHub hosted repository version, and so on. See git diff.\nadd\nThis command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.\nYou use add to tell Git which files you're ready to commit. When add is called with specific files or directories, only those specific files or folders get staged. This is handy because sometimes you don't want to commit all changes that you've made.\nAdd the git.md file to the index. You're ready to commit your change!\n/Private-Code$ git add protocol-book/01_Linux/git.md\n\nThere shouldn't be any output from git add, but run a subsequent status:\n/Private-Code$ git status\n\nOutput:\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git reset HEAD ...\" to unstage)\n\n    modified:   protocol-book/01_Linux/git.md\n\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add ...\" to include in what will be committed)\n\n    tutorial.txt\n\nHere Git tells us that git.md is ready to be committed. Notice that tutorial.txt is still not staged, Git is still telling us if we want to add that file, we would need to run another git add.\nGo ahead and delete tutorial.txt with rm. We don't need that file anymore.\n/Private-Code$ rm tutorial.txt\n\ncommit\nStores the current contents of the index in a new commit along with a log message from the user describing the changes.\nWith git commit you are stepping forward in your local repository history to a new permenant change. If you add -m 'your text here' (or --message='your text here') you can commit with a comment describing what you've done or changes that you've made. Let's try a git commit with a comment:\n/Private-Code$ git commit -m \"Adding my name to the protocol-book git manpage.\"\n\nResult:\n[master efa78ff] Adding my name to the protocol-book git manpage\n 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)\n\nGreat! You've made your first git commit. If you try another git status command, Git should tell you the following:\nOn branch master\nYour branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.\n  (use \"git push\" to publish your local commits)\nnothing to commit, working directory clean\n\n11/20/17 ACR I just discovered that you can use -m twice to get a title (or summary) and a description for your commit. This is more elegant than a single long message passed to git. This might be specific to Github. Not sure...\n/Private-Code$ git commit -m \"Add Name: Alex\" -m \"Adding my name to the protocol-book git manpage. This is a part of the git tutorial!\"\n\npush\nUpdates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects necessary to complete the given refs.\nThe command, git push allows you to \"push\" your local commits to the remote GitHub hosted version of the repository. You have to push to allow other users to acces your changes with a git pull. Notice the git status output following your commit above:\nYour branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.\n\nLet's correct this with a push. git push can take arguments if you are pushing to a different branch, for example. For now, if you just put git push, your commits get pushed to origin/master, since you are also on branch master.\n/Private-Code$ git push\n\nYou should get some output that looks somewhat like this, confirming that the push was successful:\nWriting objects: 100% (6/6), 767 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.\nTotal 6 (delta 5), reused 0 (delta 0)\nremote: Resolving deltas: 100% (5/5), completed with 5 local objects.\nTo https://github.com/hsalis/Private-Code\n   badda93..fd23da8  master -> master\n\nstash\nStash the changes in a dirty working directory away. Use git stash when you want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working directory. The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.\nSometimes, you'll be working on some tracked files, but you need to pull a bunch of recent changes from the remote repository. If you try to pull immediately, Git will notice what is referred to as a merge conflict between the files you've changed and the corresponding files on the remote repo, without the changes. A good way of going about this, is to stash your current draft files, and then \"unstash\" with the following commands:\n/Private-Code$ git stash\n/Private-Code$ git pull\n\nOk you've pulled the other changes. But we want your modified files back:\n/Private-Code$ git stash pop\n\nIf you do a git status, you should see your files listed under tracked files with changes.\ncheckout\nUpdates files in the working tree to match the version in the index or the specified tree. If no paths are given, git checkout will also update HEAD to set the specified branch as the current branch.\nI use this sometimes when I have a modified file that I don't want to keep, and instead I just want the latest version of this file on the remote repo. Easy enough:\n/Private-Code$ git checkout filename\n\nGit Masters\n\nAlex Reis\n\nResources\n\nGit documentation\nGetting Started - Git Basics\nWhat is Git\ngit - the simple guide\n\nThere are many more commands and more complex usage of the commands that I've described above.

It is the most common way to access remote Linux and Unix-like servers. In the Salis lab, you will likely need to connect to the original \"Salis Webserver\" (Dell XPS), our compute cluster (spartacus), any number of available high-performance-computing (HPC) systems at our disposal (e.g. Texas Advanced Computing Center), and/or cloud computing resources (e.g. Amazon Web Services (AWS)) to run model predictions or simulations. ssh is your go-to tool to connect to these computing resources, no matter where you are! The following describes how to connect to our servers from either Windows or Linux (for MacOS follow the Linux instructions).\nNote: Email Dr. Salis to receive a username, password, and the IP address for the lab's computing resources.\nConnecting to the COE-VPN\nIf you are trying to remotely access servers located within the College of Engineering (COE) network (e.g. the XPS server in lab), you'll need to connect to the COE Virtual Private Network (COE-VPN). The software is constantly changing, so you'll need to find what the current client is and how to install it. Download the software and login with your student access ID and password. To find the client, google \"COE VPN PSU\" or try this link: http://www.ncts.psu.edu/vpn/index.aspx. No promise that link still works. Currently, we are using the Global Protect client.\nWindows\nWithin Windows, you'll need to use an SSH Client. Here are a few I've used:\nSSH Secure Shell | Click \"Quick Connect\". Paste in the server IP-address under \"Host Name\". Put your username in the \"User Name\" field. Click connect. You will be prompted to provide your password to login. Because you read up on Linux, you can immediately start typing some commands in!\nMobaXterm | Click Session > SSH, and fill in host and username as described above. You can save sessions so that you don't need to remember the IP-addresses.\nNote: In many cases, depending on what network you are on, you won't be able to directly connect to spartacus1 because it has an IPv6 address. In Windows, to connect to spartacus1, I connect to the XPS server located in lab, and from that ssh session, ssh again into spartacus1. If you need to do this, I recommend you read up on Linux ssh below.\nLinux\nLinux ssh is much more simple. Open up the terminal, and write ssh followed by the address name!\n$ ssh alex@188.85.194.223\n\nThis command would login to the user alex on the server with address 188.85.194.223. On my own machine, my local user is also conveniently alex, so I actually can just write:\n$ ssh 188.85.194.223\n\nTo obtain the same outcome. Of course, the server will prompt you for your password. Type it in, hit Enter, and you're good to go.\nWhen you login to a server for the first time from a linux machine, you'll be prompted to \"authenticate\" or \"allow\" the connection. Just write \"yes\" or \"Y\" and hit Enter.\nThe authenticity of host '188.85.194.223 (188.85.194.223)' can't be established.\nRSA key fingerprint is SHA256:7jmnAjNhm47ijc5rnfozuyCfyESxg0sOIAk7VqZIHxc.\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\n\nAnd you're good to go!\nCreating a server alias\nNow, if you're like me and you don't like memorizing IP addresses, you probably want a way to save the server address and even link it to an easy-to-remember alias. Don't worry ssh protocol has got you covered. Complete the following steps:\nNavigate home. Create a subdirectory .ssh using mkdir. Open up a file named config in that directory. Here I'm using the command subl which calls Sublime Text, my preferred text editor for code, markup and prose:\n$ cd ~\n$ mkdir .ssh\n$ subl .ssh/config\n\nWithin this file, you can add hosts as needed. There are numerous help pages that describe all the different options, however, I find the following settings are sufficient. Nicknames for the hosts are up to you! I recommand short, memorable words, so that it is easy to login via CL.\nHost fakeserver\n   HostName 188.85.194.223\n   User alex\n   ServerAliveInterval 120\n   ServerAliveCountMax 30\n\nSave the config file. Now try ssh with the new alias.\n$ ssh fakeserver\n\nTeredo tunneling with miredo\nOn linux machines, we are currently using Teredo IPv6 tunneling services to connect to the IPv6 world from the IPv4 one. Maybe someday everything will be IPv6, or maybe IPv4 will more naturally communicate with IPv6. Specifically, on Ubuntu-derived distros, we have been using miredo. You'll need to install this if you want to connect directly to spartacus1. The XPS server in lab has this installed, and this is how it communicates with spartacus1. In the terminal install using the following:\n$ sudo apt-get install miredo\n\nYou should be good to go.\nTransfering files to-and-from a remote server with scp\nTo transfer a file to a directory on a remote server type the following:\n$ scp path/to/myfile.txt alex@188.85.194.223:~/destination/file/location\n\nTo download a file from a remote server and rename it, type the following:\n$ scp alex@188.85.194.223:~/destination/file/location/myfile.txt path/to/myfile_from_server.txt\n\nAnd if you have an alias for your server defined in config:\n$ scp spartacus:~/path/to/file.txt path/to/my/file.txt\n\nGoogle around for more usage directions, but this is about it! Use the -r flag if you're trying to transfer a directory with contents in it.\n"},"computational-workflow/server-computing/high-performance-computing.html":{"url":"computational-workflow/server-computing/high-performance-computing.html","title":"High performance computing","keywords":"","body":"High performance computing\n"},"computational-workflow/server-computing/cloud-computing.html":{"url":"computational-workflow/server-computing/cloud-computing.html","title":"Cloud computing","keywords":"","body":"Cloud computing\n"},"computational-workflow/dev/":{"url":"computational-workflow/dev/","title":"Dev","keywords":"","body":"Dev\n"},"computational-workflow/dev/how-to-be-a-pythonista.html":{"url":"computational-workflow/dev/how-to-be-a-pythonista.html","title":"How to be a Pythonista","keywords":"","body":"How to be a Pythonista\nIf you are starting out on a computational project, check out Nick Loman & Mick Watson's So you want to be a computational biologist? commentary in 2013 Nature Biotechnology issue.\n"},"computational-workflow/dev/developing-python-packages.html":{"url":"computational-workflow/dev/developing-python-packages.html","title":"Developing python packages","keywords":"","body":"Developing python packages\n"},"computational-workflow/dev/setting-up-a-repo.html":{"url":"computational-workflow/dev/setting-up-a-repo.html","title":"Setting up a repo","keywords":"","body":"Setting up a repo\n"},"salis-lab-software/dna-compiler/":{"url":"salis-lab-software/dna-compiler/","title":"DNA Compiler","keywords":"","body":"DNA Compiler\n"},"salis-lab-software/dna-compiler/getting-started.html":{"url":"salis-lab-software/dna-compiler/getting-started.html","title":"Getting started","keywords":"","body":"Getting started\nfrom DNAc import *\nClient API\nWeb-Interface\n"},"salis-lab-software/dna-compiler/dependencies.html":{"url":"salis-lab-software/dna-compiler/dependencies.html","title":"Dependencies","keywords":"","body":"Dependencies\n"},"salis-lab-software/dna-compiler/rbs-calculator.html":{"url":"salis-lab-software/dna-compiler/rbs-calculator.html","title":"RBS Calculator","keywords":"","body":"RBS Calculator\nA model to predict the translation initiation rate in bacteria.

Following cloning, your DNA constructs (e.g. constructed plasmids), should be stored in the -20°C freezer. This is OK, but DNA has a shelf life (~many years) and does degrade at a slow rate. One preferred way to save your work is to transform your DNA into a cloning strain of E. coli and to store that cell line in the -80°C freezer. You can always streak these cells out on appropriate selective plates, and then subsequently perform a plasmid prep to extract the plasmid, i.e. open your work - to extend the file versioning analogy.\nProtocol to prepare a bacterial glycerol stock\n\nSelect several glycerol stock tubes (twist on caps) from drawer beneath PCR supplies drawer\nCentrifuge 5 ml culture(s) in tabletop centrifuge at max RPMs for 5 minutes\nDecant supernatant near flame to ensure sterile conditions\nResuspend Pellet using 750 ul appropriate media (LB for E. coli)\nTake 750 ul of resuspended cell media and add to glycerol stock tube\nAdd 750 ul 50% glycerol solution to glycerol stock tube (final glycerol concentration of 25% glycerol)\nVortex glycerol stock tube\nStore in -80°C freezer\n\nNotes\nGlycerol stock tubes should be labeled with the following information: Strain, initials of scientist, date of preparation, strain traits (or plasmids carried), number of strain if in a series or progression, media used, antibiotic resistance of cells.\nExample: DH10B, ACR, 01/31/18, pFTV-RBS-ackA-mRFP1, LB, CmR\nStreaking out your cells\n\nTo recover bacteria from your glycerol stock, open the tube and use a sterile loop, toothpick or pipette tip to scrape some of the frozen bacteria off of the top. Do not let the glycerol stock unthaw. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles damage and kill the cells. Placing the glycerol stock on dry ice while streaking onto LB agar will prevent it from thawing completely and will improve the shelf life.\nGrow your bacteria overnight at the appropriate temperature.

However, its more likely to occur over long culture times (MAGE) or creep into a lab with unsupervised waste (sitting on the bench for extended periods)\nThe tell tale symptoms of phage are as follows:\nPlaques on plates:\nThe iconic symptom of a bacteriophage is the appearance of plaques (circular regions of low cellular density, \"anticolonies\") on a region of lawn growth on a plate.\nImage.jpg\nSeal any plates with this symptom and continue incubating. More plaques/larger plaques upon incubation confirms the presence of an active, lytic phage\nPlaques/OD Crashes in liquid cultures:\nIf a culture you are working with grows successfully then suddenly arrests growth/ loses OD overnight/ over the course of an experiment, that might be phage. Plate to confirm, sanitizing the surrounding area after exposing the suspect culture.\nAdditionally, phage conatminated overnights will often form stringy plaques of cellular debris in a shaking culture. This can and has been easily mistaken for other sorts of contamination (fungi, other bacteria)\nStep 2: Dont Panic\nOur primary cloning strain, DH10B (NEB10Beta), is phage resistant as is DH5alpha. As a result most of our labs cloning work will be minimally affected by a phage outbreak.\nHowever, if you are working with a phage susceptible strain and see the tell tale signs of an outbreak, there are immediate steps you can take to counteract the threat.\nStep 3: How to fight Phage\n1: SEAL ALL CONTAMINATED PLATES/MEDIA.\nAutoclave once the phage is confirmed.\nPhage particles can become airborne, so sealing any suspect cultures with parafilm/stoppers/etc is essential to contain an active source of contamination.\n\n2: Bleach all surfaces that might have been exposed to Phage contaminated cultures or plates. This includes shared equipment (centrifuges, shakers, spectrophotometers). 3: Autoclave all autoclavable materials from a contaminated area. Dispose of any disposables from the contaminated area. 4: UV Lamps overnight (several days). UV radiation will kill any airborne phage particles and sanitize surfaces of phage. 5: Honeypots to track exposure/treatment. Make plates with lawn growth of a phage suceptible strain and leave the plates exposed to ambient air at various points in the lab space during a workday. Incubate these plates overnight and any phage contamination will indicate regions of the lab that are still contaminated 6: Purge contaminated cryostocks. If a particular strain regularly gets contaminated, the parent strain could be contaminated already. Destroy/replace any confirmed contaminated cell lines to prevent rexposure/recontamination\nStep 4: Preventing Phage outbreaks\n1: Dispose of laboratory waste media/cultures the same day as they are created. Waste materials exposed to the ambient air could become a vector for phage contamination 2: Clean glassware within 24 hrs of its use. Media and cells from the previous use of that glass could provide an entryway for phage. 3: Regularly clean/sanitize your lab bench. A clean bench minimizes the risk of initial contaminiation, and regular sanitizing reduces the likelihood of recontamination 4: Use aseptic technique (flame + sterile tips/media) when working with live cells. 5: Recognize the signs of a phage contaminated culture and seal/dispose of suspicious cultures/plates.\n"},"design/engineer-your-genetic-system/":{"url":"design/engineer-your-genetic-system/","title":"Engineer your genetic system","keywords":"","body":"Engineer your genetic system\nThe first phase in the DBT cycle.\n"},"design/engineer-your-genetic-system/enzymatic-assays.html":{"url":"design/engineer-your-genetic-system/enzymatic-assays.html","title":"Enzymatic assays","keywords":"","body":"Enzymatic assays\n"},"design/engineer-your-genetic-system/cell-free-expression.html":{"url":"design/engineer-your-genetic-system/cell-free-expression.html","title":"Cell-free expression","keywords":"","body":"Cell-free expression\n"},"design/engineer-your-genetic-system/bacteria.html":{"url":"design/engineer-your-genetic-system/bacteria.html","title":"Bacteria","keywords":"","body":"Bacteria\n"},"design/engineer-your-genetic-system/large-dna-assemblies.html":{"url":"design/engineer-your-genetic-system/large-dna-assemblies.html","title":"Large DNA assemblies","keywords":"","body":"Large DNA assemblies\n"},"design/engineer-your-genetic-system/cloning-strategies.html":{"url":"design/engineer-your-genetic-system/cloning-strategies.html","title":"Cloning strategies","keywords":"","body":"Cloning strategies\n"},"build/plan-and-execute-your-doe.html":{"url":"build/plan-and-execute-your-doe.html","title":"Plan and execute your DOE","keywords":"","body":"Plan and execute your DOE\n"},"build/dna/":{"url":"build/dna/","title":"DNA","keywords":"","body":"DNA\n"},"build/dna/ordering-dna.html":{"url":"build/dna/ordering-dna.html","title":"Ordering DNA","keywords":"","body":"Ordering DNA\nIDT synthetic oligonucleotides\nMuch of our routine cloning work requires short single stranded DNA fragments known as oligonucleotides.

PCR is a revolutionary method developed by Kary Mullis in the 1980s. PCR is based on using the ability of DNA polymerase to synthesize a new strand of DNA complementary to the offered template strand. Because DNA polymerase can add a nucleotide only onto a preexisting 3'-OH group, it needs a primer to which it can add the first nucleotide. This requirement makes it possible to delineate a specific region of template sequence that the researcher wants to amplify. At the end of the PCR reaction, the specific sequence will be accumulated in billions of copies (amplicons).\nOverview\nThe steps of PCR visualized in Figure 1 are as follows: 1. Denature, or melt, the DNA to allow separation of your double stranded DNA template into single stranded DNA fragments. 2. Anneal the primers to the template DNA. 3. Extension of the DNA polymerase to \"copy\" the template. 4. Repeat steps many times.\n\nFigure 1. The basic steps of PCR.\nCases when you will use PCR:\n\nTo amplify DNA that you have only a small amount of (e.g. a gblock, PCR assembly product, etc.)\nTo amplify a DNA sequence off of a genome or a plasmid, known as colony PCR.\nTo amplify DNA fragments for any of the possible cloning methods (e.g. Digest-Ligate, Gibson Assembly, LCR, etc.)\n\nWhat you'll be doing for PCR: 1. Design a pair of primers for each amplicon (region of DNA to amplify) 2. Prepare template 3. Prepare PCR mix 4. Run PCR thermal cycler protocol 5. Analyze by gel electrophoresis\nPrimer Design\nPrimers, as illustrated in Figure 1, are relatively short ssDNA oligos that will direct DNA polymerase during the PCR. There are two primers for a PCR reaction. The first primer, also known as the Forward Primer (FP), should hybridize to the 5'- end (left) of the template strand (the bottom strand in Figure 1). This means that the forward primer should be the same sequence as the coding strand (top strand in Figure 1). The second primer, also known as the Reverse Primer (RP), should hybridize to the coding strand on the 3'- end (right). This means that the reverse primer must be the reverse complement of the coding strand.\nWhen you design primers, you must follow these rules if you want your PCR to work correctly:\n\nPrimers should be of similar length. Target 18-30 bp in length for the hybridization region. Specifically, the annealing temperature of the primers works best around 57-60°C. See the tools listed below.\n\"GC clamps\" on the 3'- end of the primers. Aim for 2-3 bp of \"GC\" base pairings on your primer end.\nAvoid strong DNA structures with ΔG \nAvoid self-dimers, or primers that bind to themselves with ΔG \nAvoid hetero-dimers, or pairs of primers that bind to each other with ΔG \nPrimers should not bind to other locations with up to ~5 mismatches.\n\nTools that we use are listed here. Make sure to use Nearest Neighbor energy models for the melting temperature and structure predictions, as they are most accurate:\n\nOligoAnalyzer\nOligoCalc\nBiopython has a MeltingTemp Module if you want to do things in Python.\n\nOnline primer design guidelines and tools can be found here.\nYou can add 5' tails on your primers. This will introduce extra DNA on the ends of your amplicon. Up to 15-20 bp tails won't really affect the PCR efficiency. Reasons for doing this might be to introduce restriction enzyme cut sites to aid in your cloning. NOTE: The annealing temperature is still only calculated by the hybridization of the subsequence of the primer that binds to the DNA template, not the whole primer sequence.\nChoosing the Right DNA Polymerase for YOUR PCR\nRefer to NEB's DNA Polymerase Selection Chart and if it suits you, watch their video. We have used the following DNA polymerases\nQ5 DNA polymerase\nQ5® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase has 2-fold higher fidelity than its predecessor, Phusion DNA polymerase.

In this example, we have four primers that would be ordered from IDT to construct our dsDNA product.\nThe reasons for why there are four oligos instead of two in the second example are complex, but the easiest explanation is that the region where two oligos would hybridize breaks one or more of the design rules. In fact for this construct it is impossible two use two oligos, because the region in the middle has too low of a melting temperature to be a hybridization region. Since the maximum oligo length is 60 bp, the maximum possible overlap would be 20 bp, and if you calculate the melting temperature for that region (tctcaaactatcgataaaat) with a program such as OligoCalc, the Tm ~= 43°C, which is significantly lower than our specified 55°C.\nBulk Primerize Jobs\nIf you want to run Primerize jobs in bulk, you can use PCR_Assembly.py which wraps the Primerize subroutines.

Combine 5 µL of each of the oligonucleotides as a control. The band of the PCR reaction product should run slower (be longer) than any of the oligonucleotides used to construct the product.\nStep 3: PCR Clean-Up\nDo a PCR Clean-Up on the reminaing 45 µL of product. For the elution step of the PCR clean-up, add 10-20 µL of ddH2O. Measure the concentration with the NanoDrop. An ideal concentration would be at least 100 ng/µL for a product of length ~100 bp. If you are having difficulty with yield and efficiency of the PCR Assembly, you can consider doing multiple PCR Assemblies in parallel and then combine the products when you elute them. You can also do a rescue PCR using the first and last oligos from the assembly...\nStep 4: Rescue PCR\nFor a 4-part or greater PCR assembly, we recommend running a rescue PCR.\n"},"build/dna/gel-extraction.html":{"url":"build/dna/gel-extraction.html","title":"Gel extraction","keywords":"","body":"Gel extraction\nWhen you have a heterogenous sample of DNA fragments of different lengths, you will do a gel extraction to separate the DNA pieces and purify the fragment(s) of interest. Follow gel electrophoresis guides when doing a gel extraction.\nProtocol\nIn advance, weigh microcentrifuge tubes on the scale for as many DNA fragments you need to extract. This will be used to determine the weight of your extracted gel fragments, and the amount of dissolving buffer you will need to add. Turn on and set the heat block to 55°C, and add water to as many wells as you have tubes.\n\nMake a 1% agarose gel using TAE.

Use scalpel to cut an extremely thin piece of gel surrounding desired fragment. Minimize quantity of gel slice while maximizing DNA content. Transfer the gel fragment to your pre-weighed microcentrifuge tube.\nWeigh the microcentrifuge tubes with the gel fragments.\nAdd 600-900 µL ADB (agarose dissolving buffer) according to how much your gel weighs, as described by the ADB container.\nTransfer the closed tubes to the water-filled, preheated heat block.\nIncubate for 20-30 minutes until the gel fragments are completely dissolved. Vortexing the tubes every 5-10 minutes helps accelerate this process.\nAdd solution to Zymo spin columns, place Zymo spin columns in collection tubes, centrifuge (spin) these at max speed for 30 seconds.\nAdd ~300 µL wash buffer, spin for another 30 sec.\nRepeat step 14.\nSpin again for 1 minute with no solutions added (a dry spin) at max RPM to remove all ethanol traces.\nTransfer column to a new microcentrifuge tube and add 10-15 µL ddH2O water directly to the column matrix.\nIncubate for 1 minute to maximize elution yield.\nSpin at max speed for 2 minutes to elute.\nMeasure DNA concentration using the NanoDrop.\n\nTips and tricks\n\nAdd your cut plasmid DNA to a single extra-wide well. If you split up your cut plasmid DNA across multiple wells, the DNA gel extraction step will have lower efficiency.\nDon’t be afraid of performing \"surgery\" on your gel slice. Slice off any portion which does not contain any DNA inside it. This will increase the extraction yield.\nFor most gels, use the large combs (they have two sides).\nWhen making your gel, there is a chemical container labeled only as “agarose”. This is not what you want! Use the big container labeled “SeaKem LE Agarose”\nRemember that smaller fragments will travel faster than larger fragments.\nTake a picture of your gel once bands are sufficiently separated for future reference/dissemination.\n\n"},"build/dna/genomic-library-prep.html":{"url":"build/dna/genomic-library-prep.html","title":"Genomic Library Prep","keywords":"","body":"Genomic Library Prep\nPROTOCOL DUMP PLEASE FORMAT\nPurification of blunt-ended plasmid and addition of T-overhang\n\nDigest or amplify the vector.

We use restriction enzymes to \"cut\" DNA. Most restriction enzymes leave a small DNA overhang on one of the two strands, these overhangs are referred to as \"sticky ends\" (Figure 1). Complementary sticky ends can anneal, which can then be ligated together via a ligase, resulting in the connecting of two separate DNA fragments. Some restriction enzymes leave \"blunt ends\" which have other uses as well (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 1. \"Cut-and-paste\" cloning by restriction enzyme digest.

Specifically, it involves creating a phosphodiester bond bond between the 3' hydroxyl of one nucleotide and the 5' phosphate of another. This reaction is usually catalyzed by a DNA ligase enzyme. This enzyme will ligate DNA fragments having blunt or overhanging, complementary, 'sticky' ends. Typically, it is easier to ligate molecules with complementary sticky ends than blunt ends. T4 DNA ligase is the most commonly used DNA ligase for molecular biology techniques and can ligate 'sticky' or blunt ends. See the protocol on digestion reactions for more details.\nDefinitions\n\nVector DNA: the fragment of DNA that is used as a vehicle to artificially carry foreign DNA into another cell, where it can be replicated and/or expressed. For nearly all applications in this lab, your vector is a plasmid, which is a small DNA molecule (circular) that bacteria can take up from their surrounding environment (transformation), replicate and express genes from independently from their chromosome (i.e. genome). Plasmid vectors have, at a minimum, a origin of replication (ORI), which is a region of DNA that governs that plasmid's copy number, or the number of copies the cell will express it at. We use a number of different vectors in our lab. See the table below for some examples.\n\n\n\n\nVector Name\nORI\nCopy Number\n\n\n\n\npUC\npMB1 (derivative)\n~500-700\n\n\npColE1\nColE1\n~15-20\n\n\npACYC\np15A\n~10-12\n\n\npSC101\npSC101\n~5\n\n\n\nPlasmids also often have antibiotic resistance genes. Consult with senior students and your plasmid map to see what antibiotic you should be using for selection.\n\nInsert DNA: the fragment of DNA that will be added to your cloning vector.\n\nProtocol\nFor most applications, we use NEB provided T4 DNA Ligase (M0202).\n\nSet up the following reaction in a PCR tube (enzymatic reactions tube) on a rack. Note: T4 DNA Ligase should be added last. For all enzymatic reactions, a good strategy is to add inerts first, then valuable components, and then add the enzyme last to \"begin\" the reaction.

Variables that could effect your ligation efficiency include what type of sticky ends you have, if you have blunt ends, what is the purity of the DNA sample, and so on. Consult with senior students in the lab if you have questions. The numbers provided for the amounts of DNA above are an example for a vector DNA fragment of length 4 kb, and an insert DNA fragment of length 1 kb. See \"Tips for Maximizing Ligation Efficiencies\" below to see tips on how much DNA you should add.\nHow do I calculate molarity if the Nanodrop provides a mass density?\nGreat question! The approximate formula that we use to convert from ng/uL to fmol/uL is as follows. This formula approximates the average molecular weight of a DNA molecule per base pair as 6.6 x 10^-4 ng/fmol-bp.\nY fmol/uL = X ng/uL * 1515/(length of DNA fragment)\n\nGently mix the reaction by pipetting up and down and microfuge briefly (optional).\nFor cohesive (sticky) ends incubate at room temperature (at your bench) for 10 minutes, or optionally incubate at 16 deg. C overnight.\nFor blunt ends or single base overhangs, incubate at 16 deg. C overnight or room temperature for 2 hours (alternatively, high concentration T4 DNA Ligase can be used in a 10 minute ligation).\nPerform a PCR cleanup, eluting with 5 uL ddH2O. You can then transform 0.5-2 uL of the reaction into a 50/55 uL aliquot of competent cells following one of the transformation protocols.\n\nTips for Maximizing Ligation Efficiencies\nThe following tips will help to achieve maximum results from your ligation reactions. These tips are a compilation of student advice and New England BioLabs tips found here.\n\nT4 DNA Ligase Buffer should be thawed on the bench or in the palm of your hand, and not at 37°C (to prevent breakdown of ATP).\nOnce thawed, T4 DNA Ligase Buffer should be placed on ice.\nLigations can be performed in any of the four standard restriction endonuclease NEBuffers or in T4 Polynucleotide Kinase Buffer (NEB #B0201) if they are supplemented with 1 mM ATP.\nWhen supplementing with ATP, use ribo ATP (NEB #P0756). Deoxyribo ATP will not work.\nBefore ligation, completely inactivate restriction enzyme by heat inactivation, spin column (NEB #T1030), or Phenol/EtOH purification. (We use Zymo Spin I columns for cleanup of the digestion reactions).\nKeep total DNA concentration between 1-10 µg/ml.\nVector: Insert molar ratios between 1:1 and 1:10 are optimal for single insertions (up to 1:100 for short adaptors). Insert: vector molar ratio should be 6:1 to promote multiple inserts. You can use NEBioCalculator to calculate molar ratios. A good standard is 10 fmol vector and 1000 fmol insert.\n\n"},"build/multi-fragment-assembly/":{"url":"build/multi-fragment-assembly/","title":"Multi-fragment assembly","keywords":"","body":"Multi-fragment assembly\n"},"build/multi-fragment-assembly/golden-gate.html":{"url":"build/multi-fragment-assembly/golden-gate.html","title":"Golden Gate","keywords":"","body":"Golden Gate\n"},"build/multi-fragment-assembly/lcr.html":{"url":"build/multi-fragment-assembly/lcr.html","title":"LCR","keywords":"","body":"LCR\nLigase cycling reaction (LCR) is a one-step, scarless DNA assembly method that uses single-tranded bridging oligos complementary to the ends of neighboring DNA parts, a thermostable ligase to join DNA backbones, and multiple denaturation-annealing-ligation temperature cyles to assemble complex DNA constructs.

Concatenate these two sequences to create your bridge oligo. Make sure to annotate! And repeat for all junctions. You are targeting annealing temperatures of 60-70°C for each half of each bridging oligo. Note: If your assembly has one insert and one vector (for plasmid assembly), you will have two junctions and will design two bridge oligos. In general for LCR, you will always design n+1 bridging oligos, where n is the number of fragments that will be assembled. All briding oligos should have roughly equivalent annealing temperatures for best results.\nIf needed, design PCR primers as needed to amplify fragments from their templates. See PCR primer design and PCR protocols here.\n\nPart 2. Prepare the bridging oligos\n\nBring the IDT oligo pellet to 100 μM with ddH2O.

(Supplement with appropriate antibiotic to maintain plasmids, if needed). Dilute the overnight culture by at least 70-fold.\nPlace the flask in the 30 °C and grow cells with shaking for about 2 h or until the cells reach an OD550 of 0.55–0.65. The growth time may vary with different strains. It is important not to overgrow the cells, as stationary-phase cells are not optimal for recombineering.\nPlace one of the flasks to shake in a 42°C H2O bath; keep the other flask at 30 °C. Shake for 15 min at 200-220 r.p.m. The culture at 42 °C is induced for recombination functions and the 30 °C culture is negative control.\n\nPrepare electrocompetent cells\n\nImmediately after the 15-min induction, rapidly chill both cultures in an ice-water slurry; swirl the flasks gently to cool down quickly. Sit on ice for 10 min. Label and chill two 50-ml centrifuge tubes for each set of induced cells and uninduced cells. Set the temperature of centrifuge at 0 °C simultaneously.\nTransfer both of the induced cultures and uninduced cells to the 50-ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 4,750 r.p.m. for 7 min at 0 °C. Using sterile technique, aspirate or pour off supernatant.\nAdd 1 ml of ice-cold sterile distilled H2O to the cell pellet and gently suspend cells with a large pipette tip (do not vortex).\nAdd another 20 ml of ice-cold distilled H2O to each tube,  seal and gently invert to mix, again without vortexing. Centrifuge tubes again as mentioned in Step 6 .\nPromptly decant the 20-ml supernatant very carefully from the soft pellet in each tube and gently suspend each cell pellet in 1 ml of ice-cold distilled H2O. Remove tubes from the centrifuge promptly at the end of spin.\nThe pellet is very soft and care should be taken not to dislodge it or lose the cells, especially when processing multiple tubes. If necessary, leave a little supernatant in the tube.\nRepeat the same washing step with ice-cold distilled H2O again and aspirate supernatant, being extremely careful with the pellet. Prepare pre-chilled microcentrifuge tubes.\nSuspend the cell pellet in 200 μl of sterile cold distilled H2O and aliquot to 8 microcentrifuge tubes with 25 μl in each.  Keep these microcentrifuge tubes on ice until used.\nFor highest efficiency, use freshly processed cells.\n\nPerform electroporation of linear targeting substrate DNA\n\nChill the desired number of labeled electroporation cuvettes on ice.\nIn labeled microcentrifuge tubes on ice, add target DNA ~50 ng-100 ng of salt-free PCR fragment. Mix the culture thoroughly.\nTransfer the DNA–cell mixes to chilled electroporation cuvettes as quickly as possible and introduce the DNA into the cells by electroporation (1800 V). Resulting time constant should be 4-6.\nImmediately after electroporation, add 1 ml of SOC medium to the cuvette. After the electroporations are completed, transfer the electroporation mixes to sterile culture tubes and incubate with shaking at 30 °C for 2~3 h.\n\nOutgrowth and selection of recombinant clones by antibiotic resistance selection\n\nPlate 100–200 μl of the undiluted cells on selective plates and incubate at 30°C overnight. For the control cultures, plate 200 μl of the undiluted culture on a single selective plate.\nIncubate plates until colonies appear (generally 22–24 h) at 30 °C.\nDo not add antibiotic for host maintenance while outgrowing or selecting the recombinant on plates.\nFor confirming insertion of a dsDNA, such as a drug cassette, use two pairs of primers, each pair having one primer outside the targeted flanking region and one primer in the inserted DNA, and amplify the two junctions. Another PCR, using the two outside flanking primers, should also be performed to confirm the absence of the gene to be removed, thus ruling out the possibility of a duplication event.\n\nNotes:\nWhen using tetracycline for selection, add only 12.5 ug/mL to the plate because only one copy of the tetAR operon is left in each cell after chromosomal integration. Prepare tetracycline plate on the day for transformation. Negative controls grow on tetracycline plate after 48 h of incubation (it is possible that tetracycline degraded at 30°C).\nSources:\nSharan, S. K., L. C. Thomason, S. G. Kuznetsov and D. L. Court.

Therefore, we need to add some overnight grown cells to each Erlenmeyer flasks. The needed amount is calculated as: (100 ml*0.01) / OD = 1/OD.\n5) Put two Erlenmeyer flasks in the incubator at28 - 30 deg Cwith 300 rpm (cover the opening of flasks with foil). The reason we grow cells at 30 C is that we want to make them electrocompetent cells. The cell growth at 30 C makes the cell wall structure organized in such a way that it is ready for transfer of DNA into the cells.\n7)Be very careful of the cells OD in the Erlenmeyer flasks. The best OD range for the electrocompetent cell is 0.4 to 0.6. Therefore, at least 2 times sampling and measuring cells OD is necessary to monitor the exponential increase in the cells OD. It usually takes 4 - 5 hours for electrocompetent cells growing at 30 C to reach OD of 0.5. The doubling time of E. coli at 30 C is about 40 – 50 min.\nMain step 2: Harvesting electrocompetent cells\n0) Before starting the experiment , prepare around 50 microcentrifuge tubes (label them) and keep them in -80 C freezer.

If only water exists along with the cells in the -80 C, the ice crystals will break the cells wall like a needle and kill them. Therefore, glycerol protect cell against the ice crystals! Moreover, glycerol keeps the structure of electrocompetent cell wall prepared for transformation of DNA. The other role of glycerol is to remove all the salts existing with cells in the supernatant.

Many methods have been developed to purify plasmid DNA from bacteria. These methods invariably involve three steps:\n\nGrowth of the bacterial culture\nHarvesting and lysis of the bacteria\nPurification of plasmid DNA\n\nWe use the OMEGA Bio-tek E.Z.N.A. Plasmid DNA Mini Kit I (D6943-02) for plasmid preparations. Below, we've described the common protocol that is used in our lab. Refer to the manual for other variations on the protocol and more tips.\nPreparing Reagents\n(First time only)\n\nAdd the vial of RNase A to the bottle of Solution I and store at 2-8˚C. (50 and 200 prep size only). We store Solution 1 in the deli fridge (4˚C).\nDilute DNA Wash Buffer with 100% ethanol as described on bottle and store at room temperature. The kit we use calls for 100 mL of 100% ethanol.\nCheck Solution II and Solution III for precipitation before use. Redissolve any precipitation by warming to 37˚C.\n\nStorage and Stability\nAll of the E.Z.N.A. Plasmid DNA Mini Kit I and Plasmid DNA Mini Kit II components are guaranteed for at least 12 months from the date of purchase when stored as follows. Solution I (once RNase A is added) should be stored at 2-8˚C. All other materials should be stored at room temperature. Solution II must be tightly capped when not in use.\nVacuum Protocol\n\nAll centrifugation should be performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted. For low copy number plasmids refer to Page 21. This protocol is designed to isolate plasmid DNA from E. coli grown in an overnight 1-5 mL LB culture. See Page 7 for guidelines on preparing the vacuum manifold used in this protocol.\nMaterials and Equipment to be Supplied by User:\n\nVacuum Manifold\n100% ethanol\nMicrocentrifuge capable of at least 13,000 x g\nNuclease-free 1.5 mL or 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes\nAppropriate centrifuge and centrifuge tube for Step 1\nOptional: sterile deionized water\nOptional: water bath or incubator capable of 70°C\nOptional: 3M NaOH solution\n\nBefore Starting:\n\nHeat Elution Buffer to 70°C if plasmid DNA is >10 kb.\nPrepare DNA Wash Buffer and Solution I according to the instructions above.\n\nSteps:\n\nIsolate a single colony from a freshly streaked selective plate, and inoculate a culture of 1- 5 mL LB medium containing the appropriate selective antibiotic. Incubate for 12-16 hr at 37°C with vigorous shaking (300 rpm). Use a 10-20 mL culture tube or a flask with a volume of at least 4 times the volume of the culture.\nCentrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 minute at room temperature.\nDecant or aspirate and discard the culture media.\nAdd 250 μL Solution I/RNase A. Vortex or pipet up and down to mix thoroughly. Complete resuspension of cell pellet is vital for obtaining good yields.\nNote: RNase A must be added to Solution I before use. Please see the instructions in the Preparing Reagents above.\n\n\nTransfer suspension into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 250 μL Solution II. Invert and gently rotate the tube several times to obtain a clear lysate. A 2-3 minute incubation may be necessary.\nNote: Avoid vigorous mixing as this will shear chromosomal DNA and lower plasmid purity. Do not allow the lysis reaction to proceed more than 5 minutes. Store Solution II tightly capped when not in use to avoid acidification from CO2 in the air.\n\n\nAdd 350 μL Solution III. Immediately invert several times until a flocculent white precipitate forms.\nNote: It is vital that the solution is mixed thoroughly and immediately after the addition of Solution III to avoid localized precipitation.\n\n\nCentrifuge at maximum speed (≥13,000 x g) for 10 minutes. A compact white pellet will form. Promptly proceed to the next step.\nPrepare the vacuum manifold according to manufacturer’s instructions.\nConnect the HiBind DNA Mini Column to the vacuum manifold.\nTransfer the cleared supernatant from Step 8 by CAREFULLY aspirating it into the HiBind DNA Mini Column. Be careful not to disturb the pellet and that no cellular debris is transferred to the HiBind DNA Mini Column.\nTurn on the vacuum source to draw the sample through the column.\nTurn off the vacuum.\nAdd 500 μL HB Buffer.\nTurn on the vacuum source to draw the buffer through the column.\nTurn off the vacuum.\nAdd 700 μL DNA Wash Buffer.\nNote: DNA Wash Buffer must be diluted with 100% ethanol prior to use. See Preparing Reagents section above.\n\n\nTurn on the vacuum source to draw the buffer through the column.\nTurn off the vacuum.\nRepeat Steps 17-19 for a second DNA Wash Buffer wash step.\nTransfer the HiBind DNA Mini Column to a 2 mL Collection Tube.\nCentrifuge the empty HiBind DNA Mini Column for 2 minutes at maximum speed to dry the column matrix.\nNote: It is important to dry the HiBind DNA Mini Column matrix before elution. Residual ethanol may interfere with downstream applications.\n\n\nTransfer the HiBind DNA Mini Column to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 30-100 μL Elution Buffer or sterile deionized water directly to the center of the column membrane.\nNote: We use deionized water (ddH2O).\nNote: The efficiency of eluting DNA from the HiBind DNA Mini Column is dependent on pH. If using sterile deionized water, make sure that the pH is around 8.5.\n\n\nLet sit at room temperature for 1 minute.\nCentrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.\nNote: This represents approximately 70% of bound DNA. An optional second elution will yield any residual DNA, though at a lower concentration.\n\n\nStore DNA at -20°C.\n\n"},"build/rna/":{"url":"build/rna/","title":"RNA","keywords":"","body":"RNA\n"},"build/rna/t7-hiscribe-kit-rna-synthesis.html":{"url":"build/rna/t7-hiscribe-kit-rna-synthesis.html","title":"T7 HiScribe Kit RNA Synthesis","keywords":"","body":"T7 HiScribe Kit RNA Synthesis\nPROTOCOL DUMP PLEASE FORMAT\nWe can synthesize single-stranded RNA, from tens to thousands of nucleotides, by transcribing_in vitro_from a DNA template using T7 RNA polymerase.

The following protocol describes the usage of spectrophotometers and/or flow cytometry to record fluorescent protein expression levels fromE. colicultures in 96-well microplate format. Importantly, our protocol uses long culture times of 24 to 36 hours to achieve steady-state conditions so that the average number of proteins per cell is constant over time. This protocol improves the measurement precision, day-to-day and lab-to-lab reproducibility, and enables a more accurate comparison between model predictions and experimental data.\nTECAN\n1.A 96 deep well microplate containing 700 µL LB media and selective antibiotic is inoculated from single colonies. A non-fluorescent (white) cell culture is also inoculated. Cultures are grown overnight at 37°C with 250 r.p.m orbital shaking to an optical cell density (OD600) of 2.0.\n\nA fresh 96-well transparent, flat bottom microplate is filled with 198 µL M9 minimal media (;1X M9 salts: 6.8 g/L Na2PO4, 3 g/L KH2PO4, 0.5 g/L NaCl, 1 g/L NH4Cl; 2 mM MgSO4, 100 µM CaCl2, selective antibiotic; and 0.4% glucose, adjusted to a pH of 7.4). Microplate wells are inoculated by overnight cultures using a 1:100 dilution. The microplate is placed inside the spectrophotometer and incubated at 37°C with 250 r.p.m orbital shaking.\nThe spectrophotometer records OD600 and fluorescence measurements every 10 minutes. These measurements are used to calculate cell growth rates and steady-state bulk fluorescence per OD600.\nOnce a culture reaches an OD600 between 0.15 and 0.20, 10 to 20 µL samples of each culture are transferred to fresh transparent, flat bottom microplates containing 180 to 190 µL pre-warmed M9 minimal media and selective antibiotic (a 1:5 to 1:10 dilution). The new microplate is placed inside the spectrophotometer and incubated at 37°C with 250 r.p.m orbital shaking.\nAdditional 10 µL samples of each culture are transferred to a round-bottom microplate containing 190 µL PBS and 2 mg/mL kanamycin for flow cytometry measurements. The excess kanamycin stops bacterial protein production.\nRepeat steps 3, 4, and 5. Steady-state conditions are not reached until about 4-10 hours of culture time. This media replacement strategy can be continued until sufficient protein expression level data has been gathered. Typically, at least 3 to 4 serial dilutions are performed for a total culture time of 24 to 36 hours.\n\nMore Details\nThe M9 minimal media is supplemented with 0.05 g/L leucine when usingE. coliDH10B cells, which have a leucine auxotrophic phenotype.\nThe M9 minimal media may be replaced with another defined media, such as MOPS minimal media or yeast synthetic defined (SD) media. The key requirement is that the culture's growth rate remains constant between media batches. The formulation of medias that use tryptone, yeast extract, or peptide mixtures will greatly vary between batches.\nBoth the spectrophotometer and flow cytometry use a gain parameter to convert photon emission counts into digitized data. It is essential that this gain parameter remain a constant throughout all experiments. Some machines offer dynamic control of the gain to maximize fluorescence sensitivity; this dynamic control should be turned off. During preliminary experiments, the gain parameter may be optimized such that: (i) the background fluorescence of media or white cells is 2-fold higher than detector noise; and (ii) the data from cell cultures expressing the highest protein expression level is 2-fold less than the machine's digital overflow value. The optimal gain parameter depends on fluorescent protein brightness and detector path length.\nThe spectrophotometer records cell optical density (OD) and fluorescence data (FLU) of cell culture samples, white cells, and blank media over time. For each time point, the average bulk fluorescence per cell (FLPC) is calculated according to:\nFLPCsample=FLUsample-FLUmediaODsample-ODmedia-FLUwhite-FLUmediaODwhite-ODmedia\nwhich subtracts the background optical density and accounts for background fluorescence from both blank media and white cell sources. This measurement is useful when the single-cell fluorescence distribution is unimodal (single-peaked) and when stochastic contributions to gene expression are not relevant.\nTips & Tricks\n\nDO NOT BREAK OUT OF MAGELLAN *DURING* A MEASUREMENT! THIS WILL CAUSE MAGELLAN TO CRASH AND YOUR DATA WILL NOT BE SAVED.\nOnly the inner 60 wells of a 96-well microplate should be used for cell culture. During an 8 to 12 hour culture, evaporation will cause the liquid levels in the outer wells to significantly drop. The outer wells should be filled with blank media to buffer this effect.\nA cell culture has reached steady-state when: (i) the rate of change of FLPCsampleover time is approximately zero for a sufficiently long time; or (ii) the distribution of single-cell fluorescence does not significantly change between two time points. Once steady-state conditions have been reached, the recorded FLPCsampledata is time-averaged to reduce measurement noise and the fluorescence distribution's statistics are calculated.\n\nTecan Measurement Parameters\nStatic Gains\nmRFP1:225\nGFP mut3b:115\nCerulean (CFP) :140\n"},"test/characterize-your-system/flow-cytometry.html":{"url":"test/characterize-your-system/flow-cytometry.html","title":"Flow cytometry","keywords":"","body":"Flow cytometry\n"},"test/characterize-your-system/facs.html":{"url":"test/characterize-your-system/facs.html","title":"FACS","keywords":"","body":"FACS\n"},"test/characterize-your-system/tcspc.html":{"url":"test/characterize-your-system/tcspc.html","title":"TCSPC","keywords":"","body":"TCSPC\n*This protocol needs to be completed.\nInformation on dyes and quenchers\n\nOur TCSPC setup uses a 635 nm monochromatic LED laser.

Thomason, James A. Sawitzke, Nina Costantino and Donald L. Court\n\"The Tet/SacB counter-selection agar that was developed here contains, per liter, 15 g of Difco agar, 4 g of tryptone, 4 g of yeast extract, 8 g of NaCl, 8 g of NaH2PO4·H2O, 0.11 g ZnCl2, 24 mg fusaric acid and 60 g sucrose. The agar, tryptone and yeast extract were autoclaved in a 400-ml volume with water. The NaCl and NaH2PO4·H2O were mixed and autoclaved in a 400-ml volume with water. Sucrose at 60 g in 100 ml was autoclaved. The molten agar mix, salt mix and sucrose were combined together after autoclaving. The fusaric acid (Sigma) was stored at 48 mg/ml in ethanol at -20C in a lightproof container. The ZnCl2 was stored in water at 25 mM after filter sterilizing; note that higher concentrations precipitate. Fusaric acid (0.5 ml) and ZnCl2 (32 ml) were added to the molten agar mixture after cooling to 55C. The final volume was brought to 1 liter with sterile H2O.\nPetri plates (100 mm) were poured so that each contained a 40-ml volume of the final molten agar mixture. The large volume ensures that the plates will remain hydrated overseveral days of incubation at 42C. After hardening, the plates were placed in their original plastic bags, wrapped in aluminum foil and stored at 4C. We emphasize the importance of precisely following these procedures as variations can dramatically affect the selection.\"\nPreparation steps 1. 15 g Difco agar, 4 g tryptone, 4 g yeast extract add to 400 mL volume with ddH2O (autoclave) 2. 8 g NaCl, 8 g NaH2PO4·H2O add to 400 mL volume with ddH2O (autoclave) 3. 60 g sucrose add to 100 mL ddH2O (filter sterilize) 4.

(Genetix Tray = 240 x 240 x 20 mm square-shaped QTray Bioassay Tray for agar (Catalog no. : X6023) ; ~ 8.5 times bigger than normal petri dish)\nPlace the (deep) well plates on the proper position! Even a slight mistake will cause damage to the pin.\nAlways remove the head and clean it after use!\nDo not leave the machine working on its own. Use slow motion mode if you are not sure of the movement of the actuator and always position your hand on the STOP button to prepare for any unpredicted circumstances. Otherwise, open the door of the machine will also stop the actuator.\n\n(A) Turning on the machine\n\nFirst turn on the huge switch on the side of the machine and press the \"reset\" button on the front panel. Release the EMERGENCY STOP button if it is not released. (*broken right now leave alone*)\nTurn on the compressor below the machine (it may take some time for the air to be detected by the machine or for the compressor to warm up)\nTurn on the computer. (Password : caporsap)\nDouble click on the Qpix program that you would like to use (Picking mode or replicating mode). This will turn the machine (actuator) on.\nAdd 70% or 80% ethanol to the washing bath.\n\n\nFigure. Make sure that all the lights are on for the first three button (red rectangle) and the lights are off from the “RESET” button (green rectangle). Make sure that the STOP button is released.\n(B) Using the picking mode\n\nChange the head to 96-pin or 384-pin head.\nDo a pin firing test for all pins.\nUsing the test tray (with paper and styrofoam instead of agar), align the camera to pin A1. Adjust the z position of the pin to make sure that the pin reaches the appropriate height and makes a hole on the paper. But the pin should not go too deep that it hits the bottom of the tray. Adjust the x and y position if the camera does not align to the hole made by pin A1.\nRemove the test tray. Turn on UV for 20 min.\nPrepare your deep well plate. Add 500ul of media to each well for Beckman 96-Well Deep Well Plate.\nWhen UV is off, place your agar tray and deep well plate into the machine at appropriate position. DO NOT put deep well plate at position 1-10!! Start at position 11 for deep well plate. Make sure that all the covers for agar tray and deep well plate are removed and placed out of the way of the actuator\nThen, you can run your colony picking scripts.\n\n(Extra) Agar plates\n\nUse only Genetix plates(trays) as stated above. They are reusable by washing with 80% ethanol and drying in the oven (use paper towels or supporting structure to prevent direct contact between the plate and the oven, which will melt the plate). Do not autoclave!\nAdd 200 ml of agar to each plate. Make the plate only on very flat surface!\nCalculate the appropriate amount of cells require. Tips: If your cells are distributed properly on a normal petri dish (diameter = 9cm), plate around 8.5 times the amount (at same OD600 and dilution factor) on the Genetix plate.\n\nSetup\n\nFill wash bath with 70% EtOH. Make sure all brushes are fully submerged in EtOH. See photo. Do not spill EtOH anywhere else. If you do, immediately wipe up. The imagining panel window is sensitive.\n\nChanging the head\nIf pins on the head are bent. You might need to swap the head out & replace with the alternate head with fixed pins.\n\nClick “Change Head”\nQPixII will move head to front left corner. Do not press “OK” on the computer.\nUnscrew knob on far left of the head.\nRemove head. Be careful! It’s heavy. Don’t let it drop. Use two hands!\nReplace pins (follow protocol)\nPlace head back on. Press “OK”. Head should move to back right corner of machine.\n\nOperation\n\nSelect your container source (BIOASSAY TRAY if you are using a Qtray; PETRI DISH HOLDER n if you are sampling from petri dishes)\nIgnore the “Barcodes” button\nSelect agar volume = 200 mL\nColour normally select which option you want (generally “white” if working with bacteria)\nDestination (these parameters are flexible)\n\nContainer = DEST PLATE HOLDER (1x5)\nPlate: BECKMAN 96 DEEP WELL PLATE (or what you are using; very important). If you are using IPTG\nMax Plate = (select)\nReplicates (don’t recommend) = 1 pick & n many deep wells (70% is lost in first well)\nDips to inoculate = 5 (default)\nInoculate After: (how many picks?) 96 is fine for E. coli. Yeast/B.subtilis are sticky & evaporate faster, go for lower. (*Daniel will play with this and figure out optimized settings for B. subtilis)\nWell Offset: (to skip wells)\nStir: You don’t need to stir for E. coli\n\n\nHead\n\n96 PIN PICKING HEAD\nPin Order - you can select a default picking order, or customize your own!\n\n\nSterilizing\n\nLeave parameters alone. Pins are hot! Make sure to wait 10 seconds after sterilization. Bath cycles = Seconds in dryer = Wait after drying = 10 sec.\n\n\nAdditional Options\n\n“Leave Light Table on” - turn off when you are setting up. Turn on when you run.\n\n\n\nPin Firing Test\nAfter a crash, you might need to run a test to make sure things are working fine.\nTest Image\nA preliminary check to see how good the QPixII will pick from your plate.\nRunning Picking Mode\n\nAdd Qtray to image pane window. Make sure to screw down\nAdd Deep Well plates (see photo)\nYou can run “Full” or “Partial”; Partial if only want to pick from region from the Qtray. Highlight region to pick (or all). Don’t pick @ edge. This software is dumb. Might think that the edge is a colony.\nAlign the camera? Usually don’t need to. You can according to the “Alignment Protocol” section.\nPrepare Picking Script, “YES”. The machine will take an imagine of the region.\nDisplay Image Data, “YES”. Let’s look at it!\nYou can select the different regions in the box to the bottom right.\n“Colors” will show you the legend of what each color corresponds to on the image.\n\nBlue = discarded because of roundness\n\n\n“Tools”, you can adjust the parameters for colony selection. Any time you changes these parameters, you need click “Re-Process”\nRight click on colony, you can select colonies manually. You can “Deselect Colony” as well if there is something wrong with it, or if it’s not a colony. You need to step through this. If your plate is too crowded, this step is going to take forever! Save yourself time and plate good Qtrays.\nUse position number 11 for DEEP WELL PLATE. Make sure to check setting in software.\nWhen you run it, you can check the “Slow Motion” option. This is good to do for the first time. Hover over the EMERGENCY STOP button and be ready to press it if anything goes wrong! It will be obvious if the machine is crashing (i.e. loud!).\n\nPlating a Qtray\nPlasmid transformation: calculate 500-1,000 colonies on Qtray is a good density objective.\nPlate on petri dishes before, estimate efficiency. Or plate multiple Qtrays with varying 10-fold dilutions.\nAdd beads; spread beads around.\nOther things to do for clean up:\n\nPour springs and pins into beaker\nAdd DI water\nJust a little soap\nShake\nSonicator would be good otherwise manually shake\nRinse\nLet dry\nUV then 10 min\n\n*** TO DO LIST FOR THE COLONY PICKER ***\nSend QSOFT 1 & 2 to IMAN\nOrder list:\n\nWash bath x2\nBrushes x2\npetri dish holder x1 (4 plate)\nQ-trays\nsprings/pins for head\nScrew tip pins for B. subtilis/yeast growth\nBeckman 96-well deep well plate (1 mL)\n\n*RUN COLONY PICKER IN SLOW MODE IF YOU AREN’T USING 1 mL PLATES\n"},"appendix/lab-equipment/nanodrop.html":{"url":"appendix/lab-equipment/nanodrop.html","title":"NanoDrop","keywords":"","body":"NanoDrop\n"},"appendix/lab-equipment/thermal-cyclers.html":{"url":"appendix/lab-equipment/thermal-cyclers.html","title":"Thermal cyclers","keywords":"","body":"Thermal cyclers\n"},"appendix/lab-equipment/microplate-incubator.html":{"url":"appendix/lab-equipment/microplate-incubator.html","title":"Microplate incubator","keywords":"","body":"Microplate incubator\n"},"GLOSSARY.html":{"url":"GLOSSARY.html","keywords":"","body":""}}}
