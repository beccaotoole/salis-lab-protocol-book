# Microbiological Best Practices

### The Ten Commandments of Microbiology

1. Thou shalt not trust thyself. Humans and our memories are fallible. Keep a record and documentation of what you have done and the protocols you have developed.

2. Thou shalt not take the word of thy neighbor for truth. Be skeptical of strains and plasmids that you get from others. Verify genetic markers, sequence confirm the vector, and do whatever testing is needed to ensure quality. This will require a small amount of work up front that will prevent huge slow downs in your progress when mixed up samples, mislabeled tubes or a mutated plasmid cause your experiments to fail.

3. [Aseptic Technique](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/gibco-cell-culture-basics/aseptic-technique.html). Handle your containers, media and reagents with proper technique. Keep your lab space clean. Do not allow media or cell cultures to sit out for extended periods of time (i.e. more than 24 hours). There are a number of reasons why this is a problem, the worst being that media open to the environment is the perfect opportunity for a [phage infection](06_Microbiology/phages.md).

4. Coordinate with lab mates to plan your experiment, especially when you will need shared lab equipment

5. Shared lab resources (tip boxes, shared reagents)
