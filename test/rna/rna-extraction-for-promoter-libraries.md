# Targeted RNA-Seq

## **RNA Extraction**

**Things to check before starting the protocol**

* **Make 1 mg/mL lysozyme in RNase-free 1x TE buffer \[prepare 150 µL per RNA sample\]**
  * **990 uL DEPC treated water**
  * **10 uL 100x TE buffer**
  * **\(1.0 mg, Gram-negative\) \(3.0 mg, Gram-positive\) lysozyme \(from chicken egg\)**
  * **Store on ice**
* **Add 16 µL β-Mercaptoethanol \(βME\) to 1.6 mL Lysis Solution \(Norgen Kit\) in an RNase-free eppendorf tube and mix by quick vortexing \[prepare 400 µL per RNA sample required\]**
  * **Make two tubes.**
* **Additional Labeling and preparation**
  * **Label 4 RNAse free eppendorf tubes for each biological sample.**
  * **Label 1 purification column for each biological sample.**
  * **Label 1 eppendorf tube for the loading dye master mix.**

**Steps to minimize RNAse contamination**

* **Cover hands, arms, head, and body with sterile protective gear  \(RNAses are in your saliva, your tears, and on your body surface\).**
* **Wipe down all bench surfaces with RNAse Away**
* **Use only sterile, disposable plastic tubes, tips, and serological pipettes.  It is important to keep a box set of tips for RNA use only -- do not use these tips for any other labwork, e.g. minipreps.**

**Protocol Steps**

1. **Spin down at room temperature 5 mL of bacterial culture at OD600 0.2 \(log phase\) at max rpm \(4,750 rcf\), and discard the supernatant \[try to withdraw as much supernatant as possible without disturbing the bacterial pellet\]**
2. **Resuspend the pellet in 100 µL of the lysozyme solution \(in TE\) by pipetting up and down and/or vortexing and transfer to an RNase-free eppendorf tube. Incubate the resuspension at room temperature for \(5 minutes, Gram-negative\) \(10 minutes, Gram-positive\) \[if the room temperature is low, incubate at 25 °C\]**
3. **Add 300 µL of the βME containing Lysis Solution \(Buffer RL - Norgen Kit\) and mix by vigorous vortexing for 10-15 seconds**
4. **Add 200 µL of ethanol \(98-100%\) to the lysate and mix by vigorous vortexing for 10-15 seconds \[use the EtOH bottle from the designated "RNA ONLY" drawer\]**
5. **Assemble the RNA purification column and the collection tube \(Norgen Kit\) and add 600 µL of the lysate from Step 4 above to it. Spin at 14,000 rcf for 1 min at room temperature \[if all the lysate does not go through the column, spin for another 1 min\]**
6. **Discard the flow-through and reassemble the column**
7. **Add 400 µL of the Wash Solution \(Norgen Kit\) to the column and spin at 14,000 rcf for 1 min at room temperature \[the Wash Solution should have been prepared beforehand by adding RNase-free ethanol to the Norgen supplied bottle\]**
8. **Discard the flow-through and reassemble the column**
9. **Repeat Steps 7 & 8 two more times \(total of 3 washes\)**
10. **Spin the column at 14,000 rcf for 2 min at room temperature in order to dry the column resin**
11. **Discard the collection tube and place the column into a fresh RNase-free eppendorf tube \[use cold eppendorf tubes\]**
12. **Add 50 µL of the Elution Solution \(Norgen Kit\) to the column and spin at room temperature at 200 rcf for 2 min, followed by 14,000 rcf for 1 min \[place the RNA on ice-water immediately and keep cold all the time\]**
13. **For greater recovery, place the column back into the same eppendorf tube and repeat the elution with another 50 µL of the Elution Solution**
14. **To the rest of the 95 µL RNA, add 9.5 µL of the 10x TURBO DNase Buffer and 2 µL TURBO DNase \(TURBO DNA-free™ Kit\) and mix gently by flicking the tube**
15. **Incubate at 37 °C for 30 min**
16. **Add 10.7 µL DNase Inactivation Reagent \(TURBO DNA-free™ Kit\) and mix gently by flicking the tube \[before pipetting the DNase Inactivation Reagent,  flick the tube a couple of times to ensure that the beads are uniformly dispersed\]**
17. **Incubate at room temperature for 5-6 min while mixing gently by flicking the tube every 2 min**
18. **Spin at room temperature at 10,000 rcf for 1.5 min and transfer 100 µL of the supernatant to a fresh RNAse-free eppendorf tube \[use cold eppendorf tubes; keep cold all the time\]**
19. **Take out a 3 µL aliquot in a separate RNase-free eppendorf tube for later analysis \[use cold eppendorf tubes; keep cold all the time\]**
20. **Use the nanodrop to determine RNA concentration using the aliquots taken earlier in Steps 14 and 20 \(pre- and post- DNAse treatment\)**
21. **Run 1 µL each of the RNA samples from Steps 14 & 20 above \(post- DNAse treatment\) on a 1% agarose gel to check for RNA integrity.**
22. **Freeze down all the tubes at -80 °C.**
