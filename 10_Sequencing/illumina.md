## RNA Extraction

__Things to check before starting the protocol__

•	Make 1 mg/mL lysozyme in RNase-free 1x TE buffer [prepare 150 µL per RNA sample]

•	Add 10 µL β-Mercaptoethanol (βME) to 1 mL Lysis Solution (Norgen Kit) in an RNase-free eppendorf tube and mix by quick vortexing [prepare 400 µL per RNA sample required]

__Steps to minimize RNAse contamination__

•	Cover hands, arms, head, and body with sterile protective gear  (RNAses are in your saliva, your tears, and on your body surface).

•	Wipe down all bench surfaces with RNAse Away

•	Use only sterile, disposable plastic tubes, tips, and serological pipettes.  It is important to keep a box set of tips for RNA use only -- do not use these tips for any other labwork, e.g. minipreps.

__Protocol Steps__
1.	Spin down at room temperature 5 mL of bacterial culture at OD600 0.2 (log phase) at max rpm (4,750 rcf), and discard the supernatant [try to withdraw as much supernatant as possible without disturbing the bacterial pellet]
2.	Resuspend the pellet in 100 µL of the lysozyme solution (in TE) by pipetting up and down and/or vortexing and transfer to an RNase-free eppendorf tube. Incubate the resuspension at room temperature for 5 minutes [if the room temperature is low, incubate at 25 °C]
3.	Add 300 µL of the βME containing Lysis Solution (Buffer RL - Norgen Kit) and mix by vigorous vortexing for 10-15 seconds
4.	Add 200 µL of ethanol (98-100%) to the lysate and mix by vigorous vortexing for 10-15 seconds [use the EtOH bottle from the designated "RNA ONLY" drawer]
5.	Assemble the RNA purification column and the collection tube (Norgen Kit) and add 600 µL of the lysate from Step 4 above to it. Spin at 14,000 rcf for 1 min at room temperature [if all the lysate does not go through the column, spin for another 1 min]
6.	Discard the flow-through and reassemble the column
7.	Add 400 µL of the Wash Solution (Norgen Kit) to the column and spin at 14,000 rcf for 1 min at room temperature [the Wash Solution should have been prepared beforehand by adding RNase-free ethanol to the Norgen supplied bottle]
8.	Discard the flow-through and reassemble the column
9.	Repeat Steps 7 & 8 two more times (total of 3 washes)
10.	Spin the column at 14,000 rcf for 2 min at room temperature in order to dry the column resin
11.	Discard the collection tube and place the column into a fresh RNase-free eppendorf tube [use cold eppendorf tubes]
12.	Add 50 µL of the Elution Solution (Norgen Kit) to the column and spin at room temperature at 200 rcf for 2 min, followed by 14,000 rcf for 1 min [place the RNA on ice-water immediately and keep cold all the time]
13.	For greater recovery, place the column back into the same eppendorf tube and repeat the elution with another 50 µL of the Elution Solution
14.	To the rest of the 95 µL RNA, add 9.5 µL of the 10x TURBO DNase Buffer and 2 µL TURBO DNase (TURBO DNA-free™ Kit) and mix gently by flicking the tube
15.	Incubate at 37 °C for 30 min
16.	Add 10.7 µL DNase Inactivation Reagent (TURBO DNA-free™ Kit) and mix gently by flicking the tube [before pipetting the DNase Inactivation Reagent,  flick the tube a couple of times to ensure that the beads are uniformly dispersed]
17.	Incubate at room temperature for 5-6 min while mixing gently by flicking the tube every 2 min
18.	Spin at room temperature at 10,000 rcf for 1.5 min and transfer 100 µL of the supernatant to a fresh RNAse-free eppendorf tube [use cold eppendorf tubes; keep cold all the time]
19.	Take out a 3 µL aliquot in a separate RNase-free eppendorf tube for later analysis [use cold eppendorf tubes; keep cold all the time]
20.	Use the nanodrop to determine RNA concentration using the aliquots taken earlier in Steps 14 and 20 (pre- and post- DNAse treatment)
21.	Run 1 µL each of the RNA samples from Steps 14 & 20 above (post- DNAse treatment) on a 1% agarose gel to check for RNA integrity.
22.	Freeze down all the tubes at -80 °C.

__Goal: 100 uL of total RNA at a concentration of 100 - 125 ng/uL. Total RNA extracted 10 -12.5 ug.__ 

## RNA Clean-up and Concentration
This protocol uses the Qiagen RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit. It can purify up to 45 ug of RNA. Note: This kit does not retain RNA molecules below 200 nucleotides, which comprise 15-20% of Total RNA.

__Use the two highest concentration tubes. SLP_1_1 and SLP_2_2__

__Protocol__

1.	Adjust sample volume to 100 uL. (Norgen Total RNA kit outputs 100uL)
2.	Add 350 uL Buffer RLT and mix well.
3.	Add 250 µl 96%–100% ethanol. Pipette to mix.
4.	Transfer the sample mixture (~700 µl) to an RNeasy MinElute spin column placed in a 2 ml collection tube.
5.	Close the lid, and then centrifuge at 8000 × g for 15 seconds.
6.	Discard the flow-through and collection tube. 
7.	Place the RNeasy MinElute spin column in a new 2 ml collection tube.
8.	Add 500 µl Buffer RPE, and then close the lid.
9.	Centrifuge at 8000 × g for 15 seconds. 
10.	Discard the flow-through and retain the collection tube.
11.	Add 500 µl 80% ethanol to the RNeasy MinElute spin column, and then close the lid. 
12.	Centrifuge at 8000 × g for 2 minutes. 
13.	Without allowing the column to contact the flow-through, remove the RNeasy MinElute spin column from the collection tube.
14.	Discard the flow-through and collection tube.
15.	Place the RNeasy MinElute spin column in a new 2 ml collection tube. 
16.	Place the spin columns into the centrifuge with at least 1 empty position between columns, which avoids damaging the spin column lids. Orient the lids to point in a direction opposite the rotation of the rotor. 
17.	With the lids open, centrifuge at maximum speed for 5 minutes.
18.	Discard the flow-through and collection tube.
19.	Place the RNeasy MinElute spin column in a new 1.5 ml collection tube. 
20.	Add 14 uL of RNase-free water to the center of the spin-column membrane
21.	Close the lid, and then centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute. 
22.	Expect to recover ~12 µl RNA.
23. Take 2 uL aliquot to determine the concentration and use with analytical gel.
