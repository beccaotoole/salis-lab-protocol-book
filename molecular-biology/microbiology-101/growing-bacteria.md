# Growing Bacteria

Any standard microbiology textbook, wet lab manual, or online tutorial will describe how to grow bacteria, so I'll keep this page brief. I specifically put together this page to make note of advanced techniques to help save time and reagents. Depending on the workflow, we routinely use any of the following approaches. Typically culturing bacteria falls under either liquid culture or growth on solid media, and the ways you can accomplish growth are numerous. Check it out:

Make sure to be using best practices including sterile \(aseptic\) technique and appropriate selection when growing or working with cell culture!

## Liquid Culture

Liquid culture simply involves adding bacteria to liquid media, and allowing the cells to grow. You can grow cells in different volumes. Here are some appropriate vessels for various volumes:

| Culture Volume Range | Appropriate Types of Vessels |
| :--- | :--- |
| 100-300 µL | 96-well microplates \(see [Microplate Assays](../../test/characterize-your-system/microplate-fluoresence.md)\) |
| 300-800 µL | 96-deep well plates\* |
| 1-5 mL | Polypropylene culture tubes\* |
| &gt;5 mL | Erlenmeyer flasks \(various sizes\)\* |

\*See [Shaker Incubators](../lab-equipment/shaker-incubators.md)

Most protocols will describe how to grow cells for that given protocol. For example, plasmid extractions \(also called [Minipreps](../../build/dna/plasmid-extraction.md)\) generally call for a 5 mL culture. If you're working with standard lab strains, you are likely using [LB media](media-recipes.md#lb-media) or maybe a defined minimal media, and you likely are using an antibiotic to prevent other things growing and to ensure your strain has the correct genotype \(either plasmid or genome encoded resistance\).

#### Adding cells

To add cells to liquid culture, you can either add another liquid culture with a pipette or you can "charge" a loop by touching a colony on a plate, another liquid culture, or a glycerol stock and then by putting the loop in the new media. Once you have used a charged loop, make sure to dip it in 100% ethanol and then hold it in a Bunsen burner flame until red hot to sterilize it.

#### Fermentation

To date \(11-13-18\) we don't do any fermentation in-lab, but rather outsource fermentation jobs to the Fermentation Core Facility \(downstairs in the ABE building\). In the future, it is very possible that we purchase or build bench-top bioreactor\(s\) or continuous culture setups. Usage and maintenance of such devices would be best documented in separate pages under Microbiology 101.
