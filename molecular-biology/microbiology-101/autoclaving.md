# Aseptic Technique

This page describes common laboratory procedures that can reduce the risk of culture contamination \(sepsis\), collectively referred as “aseptic technique.” 

## Bench techniques

#### Bunsen burner

Bunsen burners are ubiquitous in experimental science, and for good reason too - they a multi-functional and are the single piece of equipment that allows aseptic technique at your bench. A Bunsen burner works by burning a continuous stream of flammable gas - usually natural gas \(methane\) - to \(1\) reduce the number of viable microorganisms suspended on dust particles in the air and \(2\) to flame things to sterilize them. To use your Bunsen burner:

1. Place the burner in the middle of your bench, ensuring that nothing is above it where the flame will be.
2. Open the valve just enough to hear a low-to-medium flow rate of gas.
3. Use a gas lighter \(striker\) to create a spark and light the flame above the burner. If your striker is not working, check to make sure there is flint and replace if needed. Apply pressure on the striker handle to create added friction between flint and striker element to increase sparks.

#### Best practices at your bench

1. Clean lab surfaces prior to and following use. Clean with 70% ethanol.
2. Light spray and rub of 70% ethanol on gloves helps keep them clean during cell culture work. Alternatively discard gloves and get a new pair.
3. Limit the duration that cultures or media are uncapped and exposed to air.
4. Keep petri dishes closed whenever possible.
5. Effectively sterilize inoculating loops, plate spreaders, and any other metal or flame-resistant tools that touched bacterial culture. Dip tool in 100% ethanol and flame. Flame inoculating loops until red hot to ensure complete sterilization.
6. Avoid breathing on or touching cultures or media.

#### Working in the laminar flow unit

In some cases you may want to work in the laminar flow hood for added security. The hood can be found in the Culture Room \(241B\) in the Shared Instrumentation laboratory space \(241\). Wear gloves and lab coat, and do not allow any foreign clothing or jewelry items contact the interior of the hood. Spray working surfaces down with 70% ethanol. Spray and wipe down glassware and tools with 70% ethanol before placing them in the hood. Follow same rules as working at your bench.
