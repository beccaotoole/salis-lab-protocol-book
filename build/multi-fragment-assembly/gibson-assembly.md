### CBAR Mix Recipe

[Source](http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/protocols/554#/procedure)

1. Prepare 5X ISO buffer. Six ml of this buffer can be prepared by combining the following:
2. 3 ml of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5
3. 150 μl of 2 M MgCl2
4. 60 μl of 100 mM dGTP
5. 60 μl of 100 mM dATP
6. 60 μl of 100 mM dTTP
7. 60 μl of 100 mM dCTP
8. 300 μl of 1 M DTT
9. 1.5 g PEG-8000
10. 300 μl of 100 mM NAD
11. Add water to 6 ml
12. Aliquot 100 μl and store at -20 °C
13. Prepare an assembly master mixture. This can be prepared by combining the following:
14. 320 μl 5X ISO buffer
15. 0.64 μl of 10 U/ μl T5 exo
16. 20 μl of 2 U/μl Phusion pol
17. 160 μl of 40 U/μl Taq lig
18. Add water to 1.2 ml

Aliquot 15 μl and store at -20 °C. This assembly mixture can be stored at -20 °C for at least one year. The enzymes remain active following at least 10 freeze-thaw cycles.

This is ideal for the assembly of DNA molecules with 20-150 bp overlaps. For DNA molecules overlapping by larger than 150 bp, prepare the assembly mixture by using 3.2 μl of 10 U/ μl T5 exo.

1. Thaw a 15 μl assembly mixture aliquot and keep on ice until ready to be used.
2. Add 5 μl of DNA to be assembled to the master mixture. The DNA should be in equimolar amounts. Use 10-100 ng of each ~6 kb DNA fragment. For larger DNA segments, increasingly proportionate amounts of DNA should be added \(e.g. 250 ng of each 150 kb DNA segment\).
3. Incubate at 50 °C for 15 to 60 min \(60 min is optimal\).
