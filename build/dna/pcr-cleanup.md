# PCR Cleanup

This protocol uses Zymo-Spin I Columns \(product number: C1003-250\) to recover ultra-pure DNA product from PCR, enzymatic reactions, and other sources. DNA can be eluted in as little as 5 uL and is ideal for DNA ligation, sequencing, labeling, PCR, microarray, transfection, transformation, restriction digestion, etc.

## Typical Applications

| Application | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Post-PCR DNA Clean-up | Efficient desalting of DNA with the removal of DNA polymerases, primers and free dNTPs. |
| DNA Clean-up From Enzymatic Reactions | Efficient desalting of DNA with the removal of modifying enzymes, RNA polymerases, ligases, kinases, nucleases, phosphatases, endonucleases, etc. |
| Post-Reverse Transcription \(RT\) & cDNA Clean-up | Efficiently purifies DNA following RT, either as a DNA/RNA complex or as single stranded cDNA following chemical hydrolysis of the RNA template. |

## Buffer Preparation

* _Before starting_: Add X mL 100% ethanol to the Y mL **DNA Wash Buffer** concentrate. This step only needs to be comleted on first use. See bottle for volume of ethnanol to add. Mark the checkbox with an "X" where the bottle reads "Ethanol Added? \[\]". If the bottle already has an "X", don't add ethanol!
* **DNA Wash Buffer** included is supplied ready-to-use and does not require the addition of ethanol prior to use.

## Protocol

_All centrifugation steps should be performed between 10,000 - 16,000 x g. We run our centrifuges at max, which is 13.2 x 1000 rpm._

1. In a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, add 2-7 volumes of **DNA Binding Buffer** to each volume of DNA sample \(see table below\). Mix briefly by vortexing.

| **Application** | **DNA Binding Buffer : Sample** | **Example** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Plasmid, genomic DNA \(&gt;2 kb\) | 2 : 1 | 200 uL : 100 uL |
| PCR product, DNA fragment | 5 : 1 | 500 uL : 100 uL |
| ssDNA \(e.g. cDNA, M13 phage\) | 7 : 1 | 700 uL : 100 uL |

1. Transfer mixture to a provided **Zymo-Spin Column** in a **Collection Tube**.
2. Centrifuge for 30 seconds. Discard the flow-through.
3. Add 200 uL **DNA Wash Buffer** to the column. Centrifuge for 30 seconds. Repeat the wash step.
4. Add &gt;= 6 uL **DNA Elution Buffer** or water \(we use water\) directly to the column matrix and incubate at room temperature for one minute. Transfer the column to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge for 30 seconds to elute the DNA.
5. \(Optional\) Measure the DNA concentration using the [Nanodrop](pcr-cleanup.md).

Ultra-pure DNA is now ready for use.

## Note

This protocol is subject to change if Zymo Research improves the columns to be more efficient. The protocol described above was found [here](http://www.zymoresearch.com/downloads/dl/file/id/35/d4003i.pdf), but if this link is dead, or the product has been updated, just google for the new protocol. Make sure the correct product is specified - there are many different Zymo products for DNA purification.
