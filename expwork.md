# So you want to be a synthetic biologist?

This is a two-part protocol book. Our philosophy in this book is to be to the point and succinct, with references to other great online resources when needed. The first half of the protocol book focuses on the computational skills. If you are starting out on a computational project, check out Nick Loman & Mick Watson's [_So you want to be a computational biologist?_](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2740) commentary in 2013 _Nature Biotechnology _issue_. _Here you will learn how to \(1\) use existing tools and software to quickly design robust, functional genetic systems, and to \(2\) effectively develop your own scientific models and design algorithms. The first half includes three chapters:

1. **Computational Workflow**. This chapter includes a beginner's guide to [Linux](/01_Linux/README.md), how to access and take advantage of our lab's [Computing Resources](/02_Server_Computing/README.md), how to be a [\#Pythonista](/03_Dev/README.md) when cooking up your own tools.
2. **Salis Lab Software**. How to use the Salis lab's software package - the [DNA Compiler](/04_DNAc/README.md) - both through our website and run locally in Python scripting environments.
3. **Other Computational Tools**. Guides to other miscellaneous [bioinformatics](/05_Software/bioinformatics-tools.md) and [cloning tools](/05_Software/README.md).
