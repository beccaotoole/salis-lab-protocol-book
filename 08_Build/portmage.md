#pORTMAGE
##Multiplex Accelerated Genome Engineering (MAGE) using the pORTMAGE plasmids
1. Make a stock of MAGE oligos with total concentration of 3-5M in water.
2. transform target strain with a pORTMAGE plasmid.
```
pORTMAGE-2 = Amp50
pORTMAGE-3 = Kan50
pORTMAGE-4 = Cm50 
```
3. Grow pORTMAGE-added strain in a culture tube for overnight in 30°C shaker with appropriate antibiotic (in LB miller or LB lennox).
3. Measure the overnight OD and dilute the culture to OD=0.05 in 5 ml LB lennox or SOC.
4. Wait 2-3 hr for the cells to read the OD≈0.5-0.7. The cells grow slightly faster in SOC. (**Turn on the water bath, and also pre-chilled microcentrifuge tube and DW in fridge).
5. Put the culture tube in shaking water bath at 42°C for 15 min and no more than 20 min.
6. Add 5 ml media (LB lennox or SOC) to a culture tube and put it in shaker (37°C) to warm up for at least 30 min. This tube will be used at step 12.
7. Chill tube after induction for at least 10 min.
8. Take 1 ml from the culture tube, transfer it to a microcentrifuge tube, centrifuge it at 15,000 RPM for 30 to 60 seconds, and dump the supernatant.
9. Take another 1 ml of the culture, transfer it to the same microcentrifuge tube, centrifuge for 30 to 60 seconds, and dump the supernatant (doubling cell concentration).
10. Wash the sample with pre-chilled water (add 1 ml water to the tube, centrifuge, and dump the water)
11. Repeat step 9 once if the growth media is LB lennox and repeat step 9 twice if the media is SOC.
12. Add 45-50 ul of the MAGE oligos to the microcentrifuge tube, resuspending the cells and transfer them to an electroporation cuvette.
13. Incubate on ice 1 min and then put the cuvette into electroporator (Eppendorf 2510), set the voltage to 2500 and electroporate.
14. Add 500 uL SOC to tube and incubate 15 min in 30C incubator.
14. Transfer contents from cuvette to prewarmed media tube from step 6.
15. Put the tube into 30°C shaker to let the cells grow. This is the end of one cycle. It usually take 2-3 hr for the cells to reach the OD≈0.5-0.7 again.
16. To perform more MAGE cycles, use the culture tube from step 13 and go to step 4.

## Curing pORTMAGE plasmids after integrating
1. Pick colonies of interest from plate and inoculate two tubes of LB (or SOC) per colony. Be sure to label tubes accordingly, so that each colony picked has two tubes.

    a. Dip the tip (with gentle pipetting) for the first tube, filled with non-selective media

    b. Drop tip with remaining cells into second tube with antibiotic associated with your pORTMAGE plasmid

2. Grow cells ~4-8 hours.
3. Assess ODs of antibiotic tubes. Tubes with no growth are cured (validate with additional round if necessary).
4. Centrifuge non-selective tubes for 10 mins at 4750 rpm. Decant supernatant.
5. Dip red tip into pellet and resuspend cells on tip in 100 ul of water. Vortex 1 min for colony PCR template  (integration validation/sequencing only)
6. Sterilize inoculation loop, and dip into pellet. Streak onto nonselective plate (selective/counterselctive plate if genome integrating), sterilizing loop between streaks. 
7. Make labeled cryostock of leftover pellet.
8. Incubate streaked plate 8-12 hrs.
9. Colony PCR for quality control of picked colonies. Validate band lengths for genome integration, etc. Dispose of plates/cyrostocks that do not pass QC.
10. Repeat steps 1-9 on colonies that pass QC for integration, etc
