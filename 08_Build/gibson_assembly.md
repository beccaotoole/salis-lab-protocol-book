#### CBAR Mix Recipe

[Source](http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/protocols/554#/procedure)

1. Prepare 5X ISO buffer. Six ml of this buffer can be prepared by combining the following:

* 3 ml of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5
* 150 μl of 2 M MgCl2
* 60 μl of 100 mM dGTP
* 60 μl of 100 mM dATP
* 60 μl of 100 mM dTTP
* 60 μl of 100 mM dCTP
* 300 μl of 1 M DTT
* 1.5 g PEG-8000
* 300 μl of 100 mM NAD
* Add water to 6 ml
* Aliquot 100 μl and store at -20 °C

2. Prepare an assembly master mixture. This can be prepared by combining the following:

* 320 μl 5X ISO buffer
* 0.64 μl of 10 U/ μl T5 exo
* 20 μl of 2 U/μl Phusion pol
* 160 μl of 40 U/μl Taq lig
* Add water to 1.2 ml

Aliquot 15 μl and store at -20 °C. This assembly mixture can be stored at -20 °C for at least one year. The enzymes remain active following at least 10 freeze-thaw cycles.

This is ideal for the assembly of DNA molecules with 20-150 bp overlaps. For DNA molecules overlapping by larger than 150 bp, prepare the assembly mixture by using 3.2 μl of 10 U/ μl T5 exo.

3. Thaw a 15 μl assembly mixture aliquot and keep on ice until ready to be used.

4. Add 5 μl of DNA to be assembled to the master mixture. The DNA should be in equimolar amounts. Use 10-100 ng of each ~6 kb DNA fragment. For larger DNA segments, increasingly proportionate amounts of DNA should be added \(e.g. 250 ng of each 150 kb DNA segment\).

5. Incubate at 50 °C for 15 to 60 min \(60 min is optimal\).
