# Gel extraction



Make a 1% agarose gel using TAE. See “TAE Gel” under Media Recipes.



Add 2-3 ul of 1 kb ladder and all cut plasmid DNA to the extra-wide wells in the agarose gel. Run large gels between 90-120 V and small gels between 60-90 V \(running gels at too high of a current will cause the gel to melt/denature\). Verify that the gel holder is positioned with wells at negative terminus \(black\). Verify hydrogen bubble production at negative terminus.



When DNA fragments are well separated, stop power supply and identify desired fragment. Use scalpel to cut an extremely thin piece of gel surrounding desired fragment. Minimize quantity of gel slice while maximizing DNA content.



DNA gel extraction: Add 600-900 ul ADB \(agarose dissolving buffer\) \(or amount as described by ADB container\) to gel slice and incubate at 55 deg C for 30 minutes. Vortex solution every 5-10 minutes. Add solution to Zymo spin column, spin at max speed for 30 s, add 400-600 ul wash buffer, repeat spin, add 400-600ul wash buffer, and repeat spin. Perform one final dry spin for 1 min at max RPM to remove all ethanol traces. Transfer column to Eppendorf tube and add 10-15 ul ddH2Owater, preferably warm ddH2O \(to dissolve remaining agarose and elute more DNA?\), directly to the column matrix. Incubate for 1 minute. Spin at max speed for 2 minutes to elute. Measure DNA concentration using the nanodrop.



Equation for calculating femtomoles \(fmoles/uL\) from ng/ul DNA:

DNA \[fmoles/uL\] = DNA \[ng/ul\] \* 1515 / \# bp in DNA



Tips and Tricks:

* Add your cut plasmid DNA to a single extra-wide well. If you split up your cut plasmid DNA across multiple wells, the DNA gel extraction step will have lower efficiency.ion

* Don’t be afraid of performing surgery on your gel slice. Slice off any portion which does not contain any DNA inside it. This will increase the efficiency of extraction.
* Take a picture of your gel once bands are sufficiently separated for future reference/dissemination



### DNA Gel Extraction

Identify desired fragment. Use scalpel to cut an extremely thin piece of gel surrounding desired fragment. Minimize quantity of gel slice while maximizing DNA content.

Add 900 ul ADB \(agarose dissolving buffer\) \(or amount as described by ADB container\) to gel slice and incubate at 50-60 deg C for 30 minutes . Vortex solution every 5-10 minutes. Add solution to Zymo spin column, spin at max speed for 1.5 minutes, add 400-600 ul wash buffer, repeat spin, add 400-600ul wash buffer, and repeat spin. Perform one final wash spin to remove all ethanol traces. Transfer column to tube and add 10-15 ul ultrapure water. Wait 1 minute. Spin at max speed for 2 minutes to elute. Measure DNA concentration using the nanodrop.

* For most gels, use the large combs \(they have two sides\)

* There is a chemical container labeled only as “Agarose”. This is not what you want. Use the big container labeled “SeaKem LE Agarose”

* Use the heating wells for dissolving the gel

* Remember that smaller fragments will travel faster than larger fragments.
* Take a picture of your gel once bands are sufficiently separated for future reference/dissemination
